While it does cost significantly more than competing off-shore bits it is also significantly superior in all respects.\n\nThe Good:\nThickly padded, zippered blue case.\nSmooth, sharp cutting edges allows one to produce clean accurate holes with ease in thin metal, plastic and wood.\nPointed tip does indeed prevent the bit from wandering or skipping when starting a hole.\nTwo of the four bits have shanks formed to fit 1/4 hex drivers. The amazon product photo does not show these newer driver style shanks (at the time of this review).\nMarkings are highly visible and easy to read.\nThe quality workmanship of this product is obvious. Finely machined, highly visible markings, and a beautiful storage case.\n\nThe Bad:\nThere really isn't anything serious to complain about, so consider the following list to be nit-picking\nthe two smaller sized bits can be a bit difficult to extract from their padded slots in the case. (I warned you I was nit-picking!).\nThe smaller two bits fit standard 1/4 hex drivers, but the shank section before the groove is a bit shorter than normal. This is no problem whatsoever in magnetic drivers. In my non-magnetic Makita impact driver the bits had slightly more in-and-out play than usual, but it did not affect drilling performance in my testing.\n\nPrice:\nThis is an expensive set of bits - it costs more than my first drill press did! If you wish to experience these high quality bits at a lower cost, there may just be a way to do so. Simply do what we all love to do on amazon - shop around!\n\nA quick amazon search of Irwin Unibit\" reveals that the price of these bits is largely related to their size - for example the largest bit (#4) is roughly half the cost of the entire set. If all you need is one of the smaller two bits, either can be had for under 16 dollars with prime shipping. If you can live without the largest bit, a set of three can be had for about 43 dollars (there is no case, and the third bit is slightly different than the set reviewed here, but seems comparable).\n\nIve posted a price-comparison chart in the photos accompanying this review.\n\nOf course this information is only current as of the posting date of my review, as prices can, and probably will change in time.\n\nSummary:\nIf you enjoy using top quality tools then this set is worthy of your consideration.\n\nIf you like short reviews - stop here!\n\nOn the other hand, if you like lots of extra information, then please by all means read-on\n\nThe 4 bits in this set are labelled Irwin Unibit 1, 2, 4 and 21. The three smaller bits are self starting, and the forth is for enlarging. All these bits can be purchased individually here on amazon.com.\n\nAll have hex shanks for positive slip-free use in standard drill chucks. The #1 and #2 bits will also fit in standard 1/4 drill drivers, impact drivers, etc. At the time of this review, the amazon description states they have a 3 flatted shank which is not accurate - mine have six sided shanks, also known as hex shanks.\n\nEach bit is described in detail below. Its difficult to produce tables in these reviews, so Im listing each bit one at a time.\n\nIwin Unibit #1:\nIrwin Item #: 10231\nHole Sizes: 1/8 - 1/2\nStep increment: 1/32nd\nNumber of steps: 13\nStep Height (i.e. max material thickness): 1/8\nOverall Length: 3-1/8\nShank Size Across flats: 1/4\nDrill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/4\n\nIwin Unibit #2:\nIrwin Item #: 10232\nHole Sizes: 3/16 - 1/2\nStep increment: 3/8\nNumber of steps: 6\nStep Height (i.e. max material thickness): 3/8\nOverall Length: 3-1/8\nShank Size Across flats: 1/4\nDrill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/4\n\nIwin Unibit #4:\nIrwin Item #: 10234\nHole Sizes: 3/16-7/8\nStep increment: 1/8\nNumber of steps: 12\nStep Height (i.e. max material thickness): 1/8\nOverall Length: 2-7/8\nShank Size Across flats: 11/32\nDrill Chuck Required to hold shank: 3/8\n\nIwin Unibit #21:\nIrwin Item #: 10221\nHole Sizes: 13/16 - 1-3/8\nStep increment: 1/8\nNumber of steps: 10\nStep Height (i.e. max material thickness): 1/8\nOverall Length: 2-7/8\nShank Size Across flats: 7/16\nDrill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/2\nNote: this bit requires a pilot hole, 3/4 diameter or greater.\n\nSize of case: 7W x 4-7/8D x 2-1/4H\n\nI happen to own a low cost import set of step drill bits (a Neiko 10193A set, in near new condition). It is immediately obvious that the Irwin bits are better quality than the Neikos in appearance and legibility of the step-size markings. Ill post a picture showing an Irwin and Neiko side by side. In use the Irwin bits cut sheet metal faster, producing smoother edges (less burrs) and more well rounded holes. For rough work on a tight budget the Neiko may be a good choice. Otherwise Id recommend the Irwin bits.\n\nWhen is a step drill better than a standard metal drill bit?\n\nWhen drilling sheet metal. You get better formed holes, less burrs, and less grab as the bit exits the material. As hole diameter increases these differences become even more pronounced.\nLess torque required. With wider diameter holes, a standard drill bit is engaging the entire diameter of the material at once. Whereas a step drill engages a fraction of that. This results in easier drilling, and less torque on ones wrists and hands. The workpiece is also less likely to be torn out of your hand when your grip is not firm enough.\nWhen a standard drill bit is too long. Step drills are shorter than standard drill bits. For example a 1/2 (max) step drill is about half the length of comparable metal drill bit.\nIts possible to de-burr holes with a step drill by just allowing the next step size to lightly touch the material before you stop drilling. It takes a bit of practice, but can save time especially when drilling a lot of holes.\nIf you need to enlarge an existing hole, and want it well centered on the original hole. This can work nicely even in wood, when drilling with Forstner (flat bottomed) bits - the Unibit can cut a 1/8 starter hole which is just enough to keep the Forstner bit centered.\nSmooth cutting step drills - like these Irwin bits - cut plastic sheet much better than regular bits, especially as hole sizes increase. I found it easy to produce clean edged, accurate holes with the Irwin step bits in my handheld drill. Trying to use standard bits often made a mess of things, unless the holes where small (say less than 1/4 diameter).\nA single step drill bit might save one the hassle of carrying a set of standard drill bits, but of course only when all the material you are drilling is thin enough.\n\nWhen is a standard metal drill bit better?\n\nWhen you want to make no mistake about drilling too large a hole. A regular drill bit always makes the same hole size - no need to count the steps - which can be very reassuring when drilling into a valuable workpiece.\nIn thicker heavier material, or when you need non-through holes. Step drills just aren't designed to do this.\n\nOther details and observations:\n\nUse step bits to quickly measure the diameter of existing holes. Just insert the bit until its snug and read the diameter from the it. Of course the step drill needs to have high quality markings for this to be practical.\nEnlarge an existing hole, while keeping the center of the hole unchanged.\nYou can (almost) double the effective depth of cut of your step drill if you are able to drill in from both sides of a hole. I was able to consistently drill accurate, well formed holes in wood that was 5/8 thick using the Irwin #2 bit using this technique.\nI was able to produce accurate, clean holes in 3/4 fir plywood with each of the 4 drill bits, as long as I drilled it to the maximum diameter of the bit. So if you live with 1/2, 7/8 or 1-3/8 holes, you are not really constrained as to thickness of your wood. The bits all cut quickly and cleanly through the material. Of course this is a very special case, but I thought it worth mentioning nonetheless.\nOn review claimed that these bits cut in two directions. To test this I tried making holes in hardwood by running my drill in reverse. It worked poorly, cutting action much slower and the quality of the hole was not as good as running the bit in a normal (clockwise) direction.\nIn hardwoods, I found step drills to be a quick and effective way to remove the ragged edges and slivers on the back sides of freshly drilled holes. You do need a light touch, and a bit of practice to obtain consistent results.\nAlways work safe and remember these wise words: DONT DRINK AND DRILL!. (I think Homer Simpson deserves credit for this, but I cannot be certain.)\n\nI hope you found this glut of information useful. If so your feedback would be much appreciated.","summary":"High Quality Set, More Useful Than You May Think","unixReviewTime":1421971200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_5"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81a4Eoib+nL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"9","verified":false,"reviewTime":"01 24, 2015","reviewerID":"A2CACLOQB5F7YU","asin":"B00004THYY","style":{"Size:":" #2 (3/16-1/2\")","Style:":" High Speed Steel"},"reviewerName":"Joe Mooney","reviewText":"This Irwin 10232 Unibit is a high quality set step drill, made in the USA.

If you need to fill side opening tanks (e.g.; cars and trucks), you may be better served by a Type II can (I love my Eagle Type II) because with this one you will typically have to put the funnel into the tank opening and then pour into the funnel. Type I cans, like this one, don't have a second opening so the thing is going to go glug-glug-glug and possibly splash a little unless you pour very carefully. Type II cans have a second opening (for filling) that is partly opened when you operate the valve, allowing for a smooth and fast flow through the spout.\n\nHaving said that, these are about 1/2 the price of a Type II and are ideal for bulk storage of gas. If you are filling something that has the fill spot on top, then this works great. For me, it's about having gas available during winter - mainly storage - rather than pouring, so this fits my needs perfectly. Twice a season I change the gas out and I can put up with the funnel on my equipment.\n\nNote that the handle that opens the cap is plastic - I was a little surprised, but it seems durable enough if taken care of.

Safety and build quality are top notch.  The safety rating on these leads is 1000V CAT III / 600V CAT IV.  That's pretty much top of the market, but not unique.  The probes themselves are a reasonable length with probe tips that are sharp.  The banana plugs have good shrouds and fit well.  So these will suit most any application and serve you well.  However what I don't like is the jackets.  These probes (TL75) hover around the $20 mark and the Fluke TL71's hover around the $25.  And yet when you unwind these out of the box, they retain that crinckle from being twist tied.  The TL71s do not due to being made of silicone rubber.  I find this to be very irritaing because it just promotes tangling and frustration especially in colder temperatures.  Which is bad when working on something that could kill you.  For $5 more you don't have this problem and get something of much higher quality.  To be honest even I would say I'm being too critical here if it wasn't for the fact that for around $7 I picked up a set of Sinometer knock-off of the TL71s that are almost as good as them!  And the key feature is they pretty well hang straight.  I was shocked!  I don't know what their made of but it's darn near tangle free.  Frankly put, I prefer them to the TL75s that came with my Fluke meters for usability.  But I will admit, that I trust the safety rating and quality of the TL75s more.  If these are ever changed to be made of the same silcone rubber as the TL71s, then these are 5 star leads in my opinion.

I use the Starrett caliper in my shop for precision measurements when dimensioning wood for projects, or for measuring parts for assembly, or other shop tasks.  The problem was, I needed something to use outside in my carport where I store my wood, and where I do rougher cutting tasks.  I did not want to bring my 100$ Starrett outside for these \"rougher\" measuring tasks, plus you know how it is - once you bring the caliper to another location, you forget to bring it back in making it very inconvenient when you need it in the shop.  Plus, outside there was more of a chance of dropping the caliper, and the Starrett at $100+ was not the right tool.\n\nWhen I saw this Shop Fox caliper on Amazon, I bought it primarily because of the price.  I did not want to buy too cheap a caliper that it was not accurate, and the reviews here helped to make a decision on this one.  I also require a caliper to have fractional readings, as this is critical for woodworking.\n\nThe big surprise was how good this caliper ended up being - it is a very good buy.  For those woodworkers on a budget, this may be all you need.  It is well built, sturdy, accurate, and comes with a nice storage case that works well.  It has all the locking mechanisms to hold a measurement, and the hold well.  Basically, it has all the features of the 100$ Starrett caliper I own, but for $70 cheaper.  I would like to say that the Starrett is more accurate and durable to justify why it costs so much more, but I am not 100% certain of that.  This caliper is well made, and I don't see it breaking any time soon.\n\nIn fact, look closely at the side by side pictures below of the $100 Starrett caliper and the $30 Shop Fox caliper.  We live in an era where there are times where products being sold under different brand names at different price points are really made in the same overseas factory.  When you compare these two calipers side by side - it becomes clear that they are VERY similar in design / manufacture, all the way down to the screws.  Sure the knurled knobs have different textures, the face has a different color / appearance, and other finishing touches that distinguish them  products end up being.  And the kicker - look at the weight of the two calipers - near identical.  A one gram difference is negligible, and could be the difference of the type of knurled knobs used.\n\nFor me, standing here holding, comparing, using these two calipers - I would deduce they were made in the same location.  Maybe Starrett uses higher quailty stainless steel, maybe they have a higher standard / tolerance for preicsion, maybe there are differences that the eye cannot see.  But, I am having trouble seeing those differences in measuring, using.  And the fact they weigh the same points to being made of the same composition material / metal.  Am I saying these two calipers, $70 apart in price, might actually have the same origin?  Well, yeah, I am.  The bottom line is, knowing what I know now, I am not sure I would spend $100 for the Starrett.\n\nWhat I like about this caliper:\n\n- It has fractional measurements on the face, which are graduated to 1/64th of an inch - which is nice for woodworking.\n- It returns to zero accurately every time - at least mine does consistently.\n- It is made of stainless steel, and has a nice weight to it in use - the plastic ones don't \"feel\" accurate.\n- It comes with a nice storage case to protect it when not in use\n- The locking mechanisms and roller work very well\n- It cost only $30, and looks / feels / operates identically to a $100 Starrett\n\nI would have no problem recommending this caliper as either a primary or a backup caliper - I am not sure about QC on these, but the one I received is accurate and has worked well repeatedly for over a year now.\n\nThanks for reading!","summary":"A good, accurate, well priced caliper that is durable, and comes with a well made case.

Agresti","reviewText":"TPI Shutter Mounted Exhaust Fan Model - 20 inches CE-20-DS\n\nTPI Corporation offers three types of direct drive exhaust fans.  Each type comes in the same 8 fan sizes (see Customer Images for a table).\n\n- a guard mounted fan includes a motor & propeller attached to a spiral wire blade guard with an electrical box, pull switch, and rubber mounting bumpers,\n\n- a shutter mounted fan is a combination of two products: a guard mounted fan, and an external shutter.\n\n- a venturi mounted fan is a guard mounted fan on a sheet metal frame, but no shutter.  The outer frame edges are bent toward the inside at 90 degrees for strength.  \"Venturi\" is a flaring of the sheet metal away from the fan, to direct the air flow.  A venturi mounted fan costs about 25% more than a shutter mounted fan, and it doesn't even include a shutter. The only benefit is the venturi sheet-metal fan-frame.\n\nTPI claims a shutter-mounted fan can be mounted directly to an external wall without you making a frame.  However, that \"wall\" would have to be quite thin with no studs/building-frame-members in the way.  E.g., a corrugated steel building.  Other than that, you'll have to build a wooden support frame.\n\nPros:\n\n- excellent air flow.  The sound of all that whooshing air is pretty loud, but any 20\" fan moving this much air would be.  There is no mechanical noise.\n\n- has two speeds.  The lower speed moves less air, but is much quieter.\n\nCons:\n\n- the motor capacitor was \"hanging\" onto an 8-32 screw on the back of the motor.  It looked like an after-thought; ridiculous even.  I repositioned it, but a customer shouldn't have to modify a product to fix a design/assembly blunder.  See Customer Images.\n\n- the two screws for the plastic cover plate holding the pull chain switch were so over-tightened at the factory, their heads mashed the plate's screw locations.  I re-mounted the switch in a blank metal utility plate.  The ground screw inside the box was so over-tightened by the factory that the threads were stripped, so I had to mount the ground screw elsewhere.\n\n- the five wires exiting the motor have no protection other than the wire's insulation. Motor vibration could eventually wear through that insulation, causing a short.\n\nOther:\n\n- high speed had minimal vibration, but the lower speed shook the entire assembly.  I e-mailed my Amazon receipt to TPI Corporation and requested a new propeller under warranty, which, to their credit, they promptly sent.  The new propeller fixed the problem.  Before the new part arrived, I had fabricated a large support bracket that mostly stabilized the vibrating fan.  With the new [balanced] propeller and the home-made bracket, the fan is quite stable on either speed.\n\n- I was willing to spend more for a better-quality fan with an American made motor, but couldn't find one.  What a shame.  The TPI motor is assembled in Mexico.  This product will replace a Made in the USA General Electric fan that lasted nearly 30 years.\n\n- TPI says the fan must be hard-wired - e.g., using 14/2 NM cable.  Since there is no electrical or safety basis for that \"requirement\", I clipped the receptacle off a 16 gage extension cord and connected that end into the electrical box.  See Customer Images.\n\n- With extended running, the motor becomes quite hot.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis is the only 20\" multi-speed all steel fan I could find, which is why I bought it.","summary":"Powerful air flow, but has some issues...","unixReviewTime":1284595200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_21"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WciTNFooL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MNZV-cQRL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":3,"vote":"7","verified":true,"reviewTime":"02 13, 2017","reviewerID":"A2D5QSO9TBF3HI","asin":"B0002E1I6Y","style":{"Style:":" R6RT"},"reviewerName":"Niviticus","reviewText":"After reading all the great reviews I was excited to get this.

Or perhaps I stumbled upon use number 1002. My model is an older version that has not been made in so long that it's impossible to get parts. When the boiler became pitted and corroded on the edges, it became impossible for the gasket to seal it because there was no longer enough metal to cover it.  The boiler is made of steel with an integrated heating element and welding to a cast surface along edges to fill pits was not something I was looking forward to.\n\nIf you can picture a head gasket that leaks because the engine block is smooth but the cylinder head is pitted where it contacts the gasket, you can picture what my boiler looked like. UPDATE: See photos added to product description.\n\nThis product worked perfectly.  I needed something that would withstand temperatures of up to 145 degrees C, and this product far exceeds that. JB is not recommended for very high pressure, which my tank is subject to, but any pressure would be pushing from the weld side into the metal and there were no actual holes; what I needed to do was reshape the edge, fill pits along the edge, and get it smooth enough so it would seal. This product did a great job, but I did have to do it in a couple of successive applications.\n\nA few surprises were that it did not set as fast as I thought it would based on some other reviews. In order to fill pits along an edge, I found that the best solution was to first apply a section of duct tape to give something I could ply the JB into. Ironically, the JB sticks to just about anything and this particular duct tape does too, and is tough to get off.

Considering the simplicity of the assembly (all you need to do is screw on 3 parts: the 4 casters, the handle, and the power strip), Rubbermaid should have taken more care to get the screw holes bored to a better width for the provided phillips head screws.\n\nThe 4 screws attaching each of the 4 casters to the cart body seemed slightly too large for the holes, so that i nearly stripped the screws with the difficulty i had in actually getting the rollers on. i should have just started w a power drill, but i usually like to do \"easy\" assemblies by hand. oops. The handle, by contrast, was a breeze to put on, and the holes seemed appropriate for the 4 smaller screws associated with that part. The power strip was similarly difficult to attach as the casters. I understand that you want firmly placed screws holding wheels on the body, but that being the case, it would have been sturdier (and easier) if they had provided hex caps or metal inserts, or both.\n\nI'm taking off one more star, because although the remainder of the body of the cart seems fairly reasonable/ sturdy, the locking mechanism for the drawers is really weak, and probably only useful if you mean to keep very young children out. the lock is on one side only, and a really hard tug would likely defeat it. The lock is similar to a metal cabinet drawer over a desk at work, if not weaker. Additionally, you need to ensure you press each one of the drawers in firmly before turning the key, because inevitably, one of the drawers doesn't catch, and will still open anyway.\n\nThe price point on this is really high, considering the assembly and the lock- it also doesn't feel very commercial grade in the drawer pull action, which is not particularly smooth.\n\nbtw- the red handled scissors did not come with the kit, those are mine","summary":"Don't assemble this by hand with a screwdriver.

It comes with two rubber adapters and four stainless steel clamps.  The adapters convert 1.25\" to 1.5\" or vice-versa.  The 1.5\" adapter end will slip over a 1.5\" PVC pipe, and 1.25\" will slip over a 1.25\" PVC pipe.  In other words, using the supplied rubber adapters, either end can be configured to 1.25\" or 1.5\".\n\nIt's easy to connect this device using a clamp screw.  To remove the device, or slip one end off a pipe, loosen one of the clamp screws and slide the pipe out; hence \"union\" in the name.  This feature allows removal of the sump pump for service or replacement, without cutting any pipe.\n\nThis is a full flow check valve, unlike some models at my local Lowes or Home Depot, which partially restrict flow.  When a sump pump comes on, the valve flap swings completely out of the way, to allow maximum flow.  When the pump stops, the flap closes to stop water from going toward the pump. The rubber seal part of the flap will eventually leak a bit, I suppose, but there is so little pressure on it when it's closed, that it should last a long time.\n\nOur sump pumps were installed with a check valve within the sump basin, since the discharge level was less than a foot above the sump basin.  When the pump shuts off, if you don't have a check valve, all water still in your exit pipe that's higher than the pump will flow back into the basin.  Otherwise, the only water that will flow backward into the basin is the small volume of water between the pump and the check valve.  In addition, a check valve prevents mice, insects, etc. that crawled in through your exit pipe, from making it all the way to your sump pump.

It IS also the same item that can be purchased under the Ace brand name (ACE 44411 or G01A-534) at a local Ace Hardware Store for $30.  However, I do NOT recommend the White-Rodgers/Ace product.  Due to needing an immediate replacement over very cold winter months, I have used that thrice on my Grandma's heater.  One lasted all winter, the next winter needed replacing twice. The metal on the end of these expanded with heat and I have to take out the whole pilot assembly portion and cut the end of the thermopile off with my dremel to remove it from the pilot assembly. This makes what would of been a 10 minute job a (insert word for a nasty female dog); at least I removed rust at the same time and learned what to do the next time it would not pull out.  For the same price, buy this Honeywell one; I have not seen any thermopile metal warping in any of our heaters with the Honeywell.  Oh, these generic thermopiles do come with a push-in clip, PG9 adaptor and 7/16\" nut -adaptor and nut are both brass.\n\nP.S.S.:\nBoth the White-Rodgers/Ace and Honeywell products are made in Mexico.\n\nUpdate 11/04/17:  Last time I needed to replace one of these in any of our heaters was 2 years ago.

Agresti","reviewText":"Genie 34107R.S Screw Drive Carriage\n\nThe life-span of this part depends on many factors, such as the lift-force needed to raise your garage door, how often you open the door, and whether you regularly grease the screw drive.  Some owner's carriage threads wear down within a few years, while it lasts 10 years or more for others.  Mine lasted 7 years raising a double door.  In any case, this part is a weak mechanical link of all Genie screw drive openers, because it's destined to fail.  As shown in Customer Images, the carriage threads are only 1/4\" wide and 2 5/8\" long, and made of aluminum (zinc?).  That's designed-in obsolescence since the entire force of lifting the garage door is on that tiny area - even more so when the carriage crosses a drive screw joint, a 1\" gap with no screw threads at all.  Genie should have made the carriage threads much wider and longer, and reduced that 1\" gap, to preclude carriage failures.\n\nIf you hear a loud metallic clunk when your garage door is raising, it could be the carriage.  It's pretty easy to tell if that's what it is - the noise occurs when the carriage transverses the screw section nearest the door and the one adjoining it; where there are no screw threads.  The \"clunk\" noise is from the carriage threads breaking apart. A few days after that first clunk, while our door was 3' off the ground and going up, the carriage threads failed completely, and the door fell to the floor with a loud bang.  A free-falling garage door is a serious hazard, especially to children and pets.  Our door is balanced, in that it will stay in place by itself (with the carriage freed) at the mid-height point.  However, if it's only two or three feet off the floor, it will fall quickly.\n\nMy advice is to immediately stop using the door opener if the carriage is failing.  I.e., open & close the door manually until you can replace the part.\n\nReplacement only takes 10-15 minutes, once you have the tools assembled.  No instructions are included, but here are my recommended steps:\n\n- unplug the opener\n\n- remove the hitch pin from the pull-bar (attached to the garage door) and lower the pull-bar.\n\n- pull the rope un-locker down, freeing the carriage\n\n- remove the single bolt where the aluminum track connects to the bracket over the garage door.  If the track would fall to the ground without you holding it, temporarily support it.\n\n- slide the old carriage toward the door and while holding the track to one side, remove the carriage.\n\n- reverse the above steps to install the new carriage, with the carriage facing the correct direction.  An arrow pointing toward the garage door is molded into the carriage.\n\n- move the puller-rope to the new carriage.\n\n- apply grease to the drive-screw if you haven't done that recently.\n\nYou may be able to talk Genie into sending you this part for free, if you have the life-time opener warranty.\n\nAlthough this is an OEM replacement part, I rated it at 3 stars because the carriage threads are too small, so eventual part failure is a given.","summary":"Weak link in all Genie screw drive openers...","unixReviewTime":1283558400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_54"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614bNB5IWYL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Co60V+rBL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":1,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"02 10, 2018","reviewerID":"A2T3L3SJAXR4GO","asin":"B000E5QFIW","style":{"Color:":" Black"},"reviewerName":"NotJustMum","reviewText":"I order this black stethoscope but got a blue non related one instead I have uploaded pictures because words cant describe what I got...Not even the same manufacturer it looks like a toy...I am just like...wow","summary":"It's a toy?!?","unixReviewTime":1518220800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_55"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CrqmOLcaL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"10","verified":true,"reviewTime":"11 13, 2015","reviewerID":"A1VPJT3BHZ9UAS","asin":"B000E9ZKDY","style":{"Size:":" 100 Count"},"reviewerName":"Tech Geek Reviews","reviewText":"I'm an electrical engineer and very particular about secure wiring and strain relief.

When you then screw things back together, perhaps with new tape on the male end which is easier to clean, the tiny pieces all get pushed out of the much harder to clear female end and foul the gas line, potentially damaging whatever appliances you have connected or clogging a filter at best.  I had a propane distribution arrangement constructed of several T's and such, and when I needed to remove one fitting for a change, this fact forced me to deconstruct the entire arrangement so that I could effectively get all the little bits and pieces out of the fittings.  What a pain!  I wasn't about to do that again, so this hit the trash and I picked up some liquid PTFE thread seal, which works MUCH better.

Dyna-mat is a car audio product designed to absorb vibrations and is commonly adhered to car doors, floors and the likes of which you would like to minimize rattles and noise. The double layer I had applied probably added 3/16\" of thickness to the coating that was there. FYI - I really like the Dyna-mat on the outside of the sink as it really reduces the thin and hollow sound of a stainless sink. It makes it a dull thud when you bump dishes and pans into it now. It is so much better. Here's what I bough on Amazon if anyone is interested:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dynamat-10425-18-34-x-32-34-x-0-067-34-Thick-Self-Adhesive-Sound-Deadener-with-Xtreme-Wedge-Pack/dp/B00020CAVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dynamat 10425 18\" x 32\" x 0.067\" Thick Self-Adhesive Sound Deadener with Xtreme Wedge Pack</a>&nbsp;I purchased 2 and cut them in half lengthwise. Be careful of the sharp foil edges.\n\nSo I wasn't really sure the hook would stick well with that thickness sink wall. Well it does stick good. I found that the magnet is actually removable from the hook. See photos. The magnet also has a rounded domed surface on one side and a significant flat spot on the other. You can use either side you want. So if you want your hook to rotate freely use the domed side, if you want it to rotate less freely then use the flat side to the sink. I could still rotate it with the flat side down, but it was noticeably harder to do so.\n\nI also noticed that the magnet will stick slightly to my stainless sink, not enough to hold it up but it does have a slight attraction. The iron plates were easy to apply to the right side of my sink and was long enough to go from corner to corner. The strength is enough to hold a wet sponge easily or a long handled scrub brush. On the fridge it is very strong. Don't get it around your smart phone or computer!\n\nI like the design. It is easy to clean when it needed, but I have found that it remains pretty clean by default. It sure beats those suction cup holders we had been using prior to reviewing this. I wasn't sure how useful the hook would be but then I discovered that you can simply bend the hook to be tighter or wider. Now the things that I would like to fit on the hook do fit better and more easily.\n\nThis is a pretty neat idea to a long needed to be addressed issue. I now want to look at the sponge holder and ledge. Please feel free to ask any questions and I will try to answer them. I did think about giving it four stars because it is a bit pricey, but after using it a while, it is more than a novelty to me. Hopefully it will come down in price soon. Should be in the mid twenties IMO. Hope this helps.","summary":"Great Design.

I have the truck to pull my 41' fifth wheel.  When hauling the 16k pound trailer, the gas mileage drops to about 8 or 9 mpg, hence the auxiliary tank install.  Enough about the reasoning, lets get to the kit.\n\nIt was easy to install, plain and simple.  The tank took a lot more time of jockeying back and forth to find hole locations to drill.  The kit was quick and easy.  My Ford has a metal fuel line from the fill cap, transitioning to rubber after about a foot.  I was able to cut back the rubber line and install the kit at the transition from metal to rubber.  I did have to cut about 4-5\" of rubber hose back and use one of the couplers provided (see photos).  The parts fit together perfectly and wasn't difficult to line everything up.\n\nBe absolutely sure to install the kit with the fill valve as perfectly vertical as possible.  If it is not vertical, the check valve will not work correctly and you will lose fuel, as much as 60 gallons if you don't notice the issue.\n\nI also recommend using a larger hole saw for the fuel line from the tank to the truck's fuel line.

I understand that the tape is supposed to be easier to remove, and not leave residue, which was the main appeal of gaffer tape to me, but I still expected the adhesive to be strong. So I don't know if this is the fault of this particular brand of tape, or if this is how gaffer tape is 'supposed to be'.. Maybe more experienced users of gaffer tape can comment.\n\nTo illustrate, I've attached two photos of the peeling tape. I tried to repair the cheap vinyl (I think) fabric of my desk chair, which had several tears. I made sure the surface was clean, and pressed down all the edges of the tape firmly, but the peeling started almost immediately.

One of the sharpest curves is also at one of the steepest areas and we've come to realize that it's an accident just waiting to happen.  While there's not heavy traffic on our driveway, there have been a couple of instances when \"perfect timing\" resulted in near collisions -- the most recent being me driving up and meeting a UPS truck barreling down the driveway.  We met unexpectedly on this sharp curve and skidded to a stop only inches apart.  I did an Amazon search for convex security mirrors and placed an order that same day.\n\nWe decided to go with the 18-inch version of this mirror.  For the first couple of weeks, I sort of wished that I'd ordered the next size up.  Because the mirror is in a heavily wooded area, I felt that it wasn't as visible on overcast days.  We're still happy with it, though.  It's working well for us now and both the UPS man and our mail carrier have thanked us for installing it.\n\nThe mirror arrives well packaged with the support bracket attached upside down (for easier packaging).  It's very easy to install.  Just detach the support bracket and reattach it as shown on the instruction sheet.  The mirror and bracket come with two long screws for attaching to a fixed location such as a building, fence, etc.  For our purposes, we attached the mirror's bracket to the upper part of a post on our split rail fence that borders our driveway.  I've included a couple of pics of the mirror -- one showing its placement at the top of a fence post and the second pic showing the bracket installation (with one screw still only halfway in).  One important part of installation is figuring out the degree of upward/downward and side-to-side tilt that gives you the most benefit from the mirror.  This only took us a few minutes to determine exact placement and then the simple installation only took a few minutes more (we did pre-drill holes into the fence post for the long screws).","summary":"Convex outdoor security mirror is a reassuring addition to our landscaping","unixReviewTime":1442275200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_106"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51DXgNfnNkL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"08 26, 2017","reviewerID":"A3LSTGAP7LOV1S","asin":"B000VTQM70","reviewerName":"Alice Wakefield","reviewText":"I've been using this, maybe twice a week on average, since Sept. 2010.

I've had much better luck using Dremel brand sanding bands for that purpose.

Yes the Dremel brand bands cost more but the quality is worth the cost.\n\nI can grind the nails of my dog many times before I need to replace the sanding band. Totally worth it as I will only use 3-240 grit bands a year to do my dog's nails. The sanding band in my photo is a 120 grit and has been used at least 10-14 times to grind my dog's nails. It is still getting the job done. I first use the 120 grit bands to quickly get most of the nail ground down then use the 240 grit bands to finish the nails.

On the back is a white button to change from Celsius to Fahrenheit as well as a magnetic clip. The readout is a nice legible size with 24 hour highs and lows recorded for both humidity and temperature. What I don't like is these units cannot be calibrated. Also, I puchased two and one arrived with a damaged clip. Not the fault of AcuRite. A suggestion I have is to check for accuracy by conducting the salt test. Place salt in the bottle cap (or other small container). Dampen the salt with water. Place both the hygrometer and the bottle cap full of damp salt in a ziploc bag and seal. Keep it like this for  8+ hours.  After 8+ hours the humidity inside the bag will be 75%. Compare it to your hygrometer which should read 75%. If it's off, note how much and in which direction then be sure to add or subtract that amount when reading the hygrometer. Hope this helps.","summary":"Check for accuracy.

Ive changed the Amazon Basics AA battery once, which I do with most of my battery-operated products every 6 or 12 months (especially with smoke detectors/alarms). I don't wait for batteries to die. I appreciate how quickly the readings are available. For instance, I can walk from one part of my first floor home to the other, and see the difference in temperature and humidity readings within seconds. The digital numbers are easy to read as long as I have on my glasses and Im not in the dark. Theres a tiny white button located on the back that les you choose Fahrenheit or Celsius. I would definitely buy this Acurite model again*. I paid $3 more in 2016.\n\nHOW ACCURATE ARE THE READINGS? I can tell if the readings are accurate by comparing different areas of my home where it is obvious (see messy images) that the humidity is really high. In Miami, FL, I doubt Ill ever witness a really low humidity reading room in my old home.  I have a large window that needs to be replaced (the whole darn thing, glass and frame). It allows outside weather conditions (heat and more heat) to seep right into my home. Yep, already added that ugly and cheap plastic sheeting over the frame, but its not helping enough.\n\nWHY I BOUGHT THIS: I use this meter, mostly it seems, just to annoy myself. LOL!  Im not using for growing indoor plants or any other casually scientific reason. I just like to know why I feel like crapnothing escapes the effects of dampness in the air, the dampness that can easily make me feel miserable, the dampness that requires me to cleanly wipe down even more crap. On a positive note, its easy to turn on the air conditioner (sometimes using the free air circulation) to help reduce these issues. Until I can find a person willing to empty bins of water for me every single day, I cant be bothered with dehumidifiers. Nobody in their right mind leaves stagnant water in Miami (mosquitos will find it).\n\nFor those trying to learn the most basic humidity examples: Very low humidity can cause dry skin, nosebleeds, and who knows what else. Very high humidity can help improve plant growth, improve mold growth (you don't want that), but can also cause a person to feel uncomfortable and/or sweaty.\n\n(*) AcuRite 00613 Humidity Monitor with Indoor Thermometer, Digital Hygrometer and Humidity Gauge Indicator","summary":"1 year and 8 months later, maintains accuracy.","unixReviewTime":1514505600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_132"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812-Xez8MJL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BoXiMyicL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719WVLpoUYL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"11 25, 2017","reviewerID":"A2U8YO765V8PGU","asin":"B0013BKDO8","style":{"Color:":" Black/Silver"},"reviewerName":"SMplicity","reviewText":"Great little accurate device.

I took the machine to the Milwaukee Makerspace and the folks there used to chew through the Kapton weekly.  Don't ask me what they were doing or how they were doing it, but I got really tired of replacing the tape so I decided to give PEI a go.

Casto","reviewText":"This stuff is an amazing build surface. I love not having to mess with glue sticks or hairspray any more. However there's a few things to be aware of concerning the adhesive and application. First of all, I'd recommend getting a size larger than needed. Often times beds are oddly shaped (200x213) or the PEI is undersized. It's easy enough to trim and not too much more to just get a size up and cut it back. With this particular product - or at least the 0.03\" thickness - one side is gloss while the other is matte. I wanted to point that out because I've bought PEI from other suppliers on here that was glossy on both sides. The color of this product is a nice deep amber (see photos).\n\nNow concerning application in general.... if you've never worked with 3M 468MP adhesive before, it's kind of a gooey nightmare. It's basically the stuff that is used to stick credit cards or gift cards to the paper, but a whole sheet of it. The first time I did it I figured applying it like you would a screen protector would work. That worked great to make sure it was straight and dust-free, but what I didn't anticipate was how bad it traps air bubbles, and unlike a screen protector you can't really work them out afterwards. While the PEI was rigid enough to lay flat over the large bubbles at bed temps up to 50C, any higher than that and the air in the bubbles would expand and visibly distort the surface. So while I was able to get away with printing PLA and PETG, ABS could have been problematic. I did some research and decided to order some more adhesive and try again.\n\nRemoving the adhesive is a pain, but not too bad if you're patient and persistent. The best bet to separate the PEI from the glass to use something like the long thin spatula tools used to help remove prints from the bed. You can work it into the adhesive and slowly scrape/pry things apart. After that the easiest way to get the adhesive itself off is to rub and roll it around so the goo snowballs up and helps pull more off. The glass will usually clean up pretty easy and clean and can be polished up with some rubbing alcohol. The PEI on the other hand is a little more difficult to get clean. I rubbed most of the adhesive off with the aid of a little Goo Gone. Once I had it down to just a thin layer of adhesive residue I was able to use rubbing alcohol and a Magic Eraser to clean it up the rest of the way. Just note that the Magic Eraser will abraid the PEI a slight bit. I liked the look, but some may not.\n\nNow the trick to applying this stuff is to use pressure as you go so that air can't get trapped. It's not enough to just bend it up and roll it on like you would a screen protector, you have to use something (I used a spackle knife) to work it down and forward. I found the best way was to peel up the starting edge of the wax paper and get things lined up, then work your way forward, pulling the paper out as you go. The curl in the paper will help to keep the adhesive sheet up and away from the glass. After that you can look through the glass to find any air bubbles. It can help to take a pin or x-acto and pop the bubbles and try to work the air out. I also found it helpful to put the glass on the heated bed and bring it up to working temp to see what bubbles show up as the air expands. Hitting them with a pin at this point will let the heat push some of the air out. Remember to do all this before applying the PEI though.\n\nThe process for applying the PEI without bubbles is similar to the adhesive, but it being more rigid makes it a bit easier to do. Just use your fingers to press down and rub it as you work your way forward and it should be fine. If you bought a larger size then now would be the perfect time to flip it over, score, and snap off the excess. After that you should be good to go. One trick I've learned for printing with PEI is that rubbing alcohol and a Magic Eraser work great for cleaning in between prints","summary":"The perfect build surface.

Originally I have tried phenolic paper that is similar to this PEI sheet of plastic but not quite. I was having a good amount of luck with the phenolic paper sheet but was still having problems with small parts from sticking on to the build plate. I also heard someone talking about how polyetherimide works very well to stick prints down. So I decided to buy a sheet of 12 by 12.\n\nThe polyetherimide sheet came in a box without any reinforcements this was a little problematic since the box was warped and crushed. The sheet of polyetherimide was slightly warped but is not too much of a big deal since I am sticking it to my build plate with adhesives. The sheet had plastic protective films on both sides of the sheet. This had protected the finish of the sheet and I was happy about this. Also they placed the product sticker on the protective film instead of directly to the product kudos to them. That simple decision saved me some time from picking at the sticker. Also if you were wondering the sheet is a slight transparent yellow color.\n\nAs for the quality of the polyetherimide sheet the material that it's made from is of good quality. But the the sheet of polyetherimide was a little smaller than the advertised 12 by 12. If you are trying to build something with this I would recommend you buy a slightly bigger sheet then what you need since it won't be exactly the size that you buy. Its very important for 3d printer beds to be flat to insure correct measurements and good adhesion. The sheet of polyetherimide thickness ranged from 1.1 mm, 0.92 mm, 0.93 mm, to 1.07 mm. This is not too great but still a workable tolerance.\n\nNow for the important part does it function better than the phenolic paper that i'm currently using? After testing it with my printer for a little while I can say that the polyetherimide sheet did in fact perform better than phenolic paper that I was was using previously. The parts seem to stick a little better and like the other sheet you can clean it with rubbing alcohol.\n\nSo if you're into 3D printing and are looking for ways to improve your 3D print well this is certainly something that you should consider to try out. But it's not a 100% foolproof fix, it's just a very close one. So what are you waiting for go out there and try it.","summary":"Good Material For A Build Plate","unixReviewTime":1471219200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_150"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ImKb0KejL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61WVDOP0bLL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"214","verified":true,"reviewTime":"06 11, 2011","reviewerID":"A2D1LPEUCTNT8X","asin":"B0013U75B8","style":{"Size:":" Medium","Style:":" Box of 100"},"reviewerName":"Ali Julia","reviewText":"<div id=\"video-block-RRCUCMJXGZGCL\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wsuy0TobS.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UwZoN1upS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">I am very grateful to other reviewers for indicating that these gloves run small.

I did this as an after thought, and have a ton of regrets on the \"mounting\" design pictured (so I can tell you a whole bunch of ways to improve on this)..  The mount is simple PVC plastic plumbing pipes (used one step spray paint made for plastic and metal, $4)..  First, don't do the complicated \"F\" shape (shape of the assembled pipes) with all the \"T\" fittings and elbows I used (because you cant thread the thermostat thru the fittings, and they are unnecessary anyway)..  If you look at the picture, note that I used T fittings to make it stand off the FRIG an inch or so..  This added a lot of complication for no reason whatsoever..  FOR YOURs simple make a F, or C shape with 1\" PVC pipes, and the part that touches the frig will be nothing but a pipe (no fittings on it)..  Drill hole thru pipes for mounting (drill pilot hole thru frig sheet metal, then use sheet metal screws..\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nThere is always the possability you could damage your FRIG drilling thru it..  You would be taking that chance..  I drilled away from the electrical stuff on the frig (and drilled thru insulation as I expected)..\n\nTIPS:\nUSE 1\" PVC:  I used 3/4, and its way too wiggly..  1\" should work better.. PVC is strong, and 1\" should be large enough to thread the thermostat thru..  You will need reducer to 1/2\" at the end to mount the box with 1/2 nipple)..  Dont mix the thermostat line with electrical wires (you can do it, but dont)..  INSTEAD of saving $2 on the 3 hole box (down on the shopping list), get the box with more holes..  Try to use T fittings where the thermostat will get threaded thru (may not fit thru an elbow)..\n\nF SHAPE:\nUse (F upside down) if you have a short FRIG, and you want to mount the etc higher (mine is an F)..  You can add a T fitting hear the top to have a place to run the thermostat wire (or drill a hole thru the pipe)..\n\nC SHAPE:\nOn a  tall FRIG, get two 1/2 plastic male thread fittings, and glue them to male two identical L shapes (of PVV pipes)..  Assemble them to the box and you have a C shape (ready to mount to FRIG)..\n\nTHERMOSTAT:\nRun it thru the PVC pipes..  It doesnt have to be concealed completely like a commercial application..  In the pic you can see mine hanging over the top then entering the pipes.. I used rubber hose (drilled out so the thermostat would fit)..  Drilling out a rubber hose turned out to be a lot of work.. I am not sure what to tell you here for drilling a hole thru the FRIG to mount the thermostat inside FRIG..  But if you do not have some way to protect the thermostat wire from the sharp metal in the hole we will drill, it will probably eventually fail and short circuit)..  Using a rubber hose was a pain..  You might try finding a plastic hose (so the inside would be bigger).. But the outside of the hose will be the size of the hole you need to drill..  Then simply slide the protective hose thru the hole (thermostat wire goes thru the hose)..  My  rubber hose is holding itself in place  by luck..  You may need some kind of caulk or something to hold the protective hose in place (maybe a dash inside the hose too to help keep the cold air inside)..  I would use silicone (not sure what is food safe.. probably none of the caulks are for food contact..\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~ end UPD\n\nUPDATE:  080711:\n\nPlugged mine in and it works perfectly..  I remember getting hung up on the long wire to drape over both sides of the FRIG..  Silly me, LOL I have a freezer chest..  At least the long wires on both sides will give me the wire I need to put it somewhere convenient (so I still firmly believe longer wires are better than getting stuck too short)..  I wish now I would have paid $2 more for a box with more holes, then I could have easily attached the box to the rear of the freezer and place it at eye level with 3 pieces of water pipe..  Hell, maybe I could use the same mounting pipe to conceal the thermostat probe (drill a hole into the freezer box that enters exactly where the pipe attaches)..\n\nend: RANCO ETC UPDATE:  080711:\nend: RANCO ETC UPDATE:  080711:\n\nI strongly suggest printing this out if you want to follow this procedure..  I tried to lay it out linear (do it from start to finish)..  Take the printout with you for the shopping list..\n\nI was unable to add pictures directly to this review, but I was able to add pictures to the main page for the ranco ETC.. I will note in the text below when to look at a picture..\n\nI bought a \"freezer\" chest because when you open it the cold air stays in (condensation is reduced, and energy efficiency increased)..  The disadvantage is if you are doing wine or beer and its too heavy for you to lift out..  Also, I got a freezer specifically, so I can use it as either a FRIG \"or\" freezer later using the ETC control if I choose..\n\nI am elated there exists such a device for people like me that want to optimize flavor fermenting sauerkraut and for winemaking / beer brewing..  So, here is detailed help for anyone intimidated about wiring their own.. I will monitor for questions or corrections that may need to be made (but amazon takes a day or two to post corrections)..  Unfortunately this has become \"very\" verbose in an attempt to me more clear .. My goal was to give the ability to wire the ETC, to the complete electrical novice..  But people who already know how to wire should skim thru for the tips to wire it perfectly (the only thing I left off was a fuse; which if you want commercial quality, simply add a 15A fuse into the ckt)..  These notes are on details that are not in the directions that came with the rancho etc, but someone who knows how to do wiring could figure it out..  I am an avid tinkerer of things, so I think I can take the mystery out of how to wire it, and set it up for actual commercial use instead of hoping it works..  There is a shopping list below, of things you already need to buy; so adding $10-20 to the total cost is money well spent to do a fantastic job over a mediocre job (so plan on buying $40 worth of electrical parts, instead of $20-25?)..  When wired optimally, the heavier gauge wires will dissipate heat better which protects the sensitive electronics, and allows you to later hook the rancho etc up to a very large FRIG if you decide to, because you used higher capacity wiring..  And paying $18 instead of $12 for the extension cord sets you up so you don't need to use yet another extension cord later if the plug in is too far away, and gives you the slack you need to plug the FRIG in without pulling the ETC off the FRIG..\n\nI HOPE I DONT GET  A LEMON:\nAs some reviewers complained..  Perhaps they installed this wiring incorrectly (there are ways to screw it up)..  Perhaps the probe was damaged (it is replaceable I believe)..  Common sense says the probe should be near what you want to control,and not in a corner so it will be open to circulating air..  I do not know if we would be better off putting the probe right on the crock... Because I feel TEMP probes tend to be delicate..  Also, see the BULLETIN below about TEMP swings, and compressor protection (this could be another area where people may be having problems)..  Yet another thing that can go wrong is if pieces of copper wire get into the box when wiring it up (you need to \"know\" where the little pieces went when clipping the wires)..\n\nCOMPRESSOR PROTECTION ?\nETC NOT WORKING PROPERLY ?\n\nREAD THIS IF YOU WANT TO maximize the lifespan of your FRIG (or if the FRIG is not holding the TEMP range the ETC setting is calling for)..  Some troubles may \"not\" be the fault of the ETC, rather the limited capability of the FRIG itself..  The ETC has no ability to control the compressor cycle time (protect the compressor from damage by turning on too soon after it just ran)..  My first thought was that the FRIG controls would already have this protection function built into its own controls if needed..  But perhaps this is the reason for some of the negative reviews (and no one realized what is happening)..  Few people are complaining, and I saw no complaints of a broken FRIG (although this sort of thing may shorten the life of the FRIG (or it may not; I am choosing to risk it myself)..  I imagine (I don't really know), depending on the design of the refrigerator, the FRIG temp range swing might be part of that protection design (in this particular case, we would have a problem), because the ETC indeed does \"force\" onto the FRIG a new TEMP RANGE..  The ETC can be set to control within 1-DEGREE, which I doubt any FRIG will do on its own..  The ETC is an electrical relay that functions like kid plugging, then unplugging the FRIG frequently to keep the TEMP range setting..  If you are curious, or have a problem with the TEMP control, I suggest you put the ETC temp probe in the FRIG, but do not control the FRIG with the ETC..  Then simply watch the TEMP range (I \"think\" you can check the temp this way) to see how the FRIG was designed to operate (if not broken, which the ETC could not cure anyway)..  Then add the ETC back to control the FRIG TEMP..  And tweak back the ETC setting a degree or two tighter (IE: control the TEMP range swing not to 1 or 2 degrees, but closer to the temp swings that the FRIG wants to do on its own), and then you will see if the problem goes away (if it does go away, you can tighten up the ETC temp range one more degree at a time and you will eventually know how far you can push your FRIG)..\nWHY 1 DEGREE TEMP RANGE ANYWAY:\nFor SAUER KRAUT I plan to use 3 degrees range to keep the TEMP exactly in the TEMP range given by Harsch (minus 1 degree colder to account for the possible spontaneous heating of the crock caused by fermentation).. I feel there is no reason to keep the temp so tightly controlled, because TEMP swings are common in nature..  But, I am interested if anyone has any theories that the end result might taste better..  MY KRAUT: 2-3 days at 20-22C (68-72), then 15-18C (59-64 F.) for 4-6 weeks..\n\nWiring the ETC according to these directions sets everything up to put the ETC control on tof of the frig (but alternately you can put it somewhere else because there will be a longish cord on either end..\n\nTOOLS:\nTOOLS:\nTOOLS:\n\nScrewdriver, electrical pliers, regular pliers too, knife or razor (and you can get by with a knife if you do not have electrical pliers, but you will still need wire cutters.. an old fingernail cutter will probably work to get a clean snip)..  You will need a smaller than normal screwdriver, because a full size one will not fit the ETC..\n\nSHOPPING LIST:\nSHOPPING LIST:\nSHOPPING LIST:\n\n25 FOOT 14 GAGUE EXTENSION CORD:\nYou are spending $6 more for this longer heavier cord..  A little too long is always better than too short..  I strongly suggest you buy an extension cord as close to this one as you can (because the compression connectors and finicky.. the round diameter of the cord is what is needed to make it work)..  I bought a HUSKY, round medium duty indoor/outdoor 14 gauge extension cord..  14 GAUGE is the same wire gauge a 15a house wiring uses, so it should easily handle any FRIG as a load (rather than overloading which leads to premature failure of electrical devices, or possibly fire)..\n\nDBL GANG (SQUARE) OUTDOOR ELECTRICAL BOX: (and cover):\nCosts $9-10..  Get 1/2 inch size (refers to holes in box)..  Also get a plain square metal cover..  Get 3 hole (cheaper)..  NOTE: if you are planning to install to frig, get the box with more holes..\n\nELECTRICAL CONNECTORS:\n3 RED twist ties, and 2 YELLOW twist tie connectors..  The ones with the little wings are easier to use..\n\nCOMPRESSION FITTINGS:\nBuy two of these (one for each cut end of the extension cord..  See the notes for the extension cord to buy (above)..  I suggest you ask the store clerk for help with the connectors (because the compression fittings can be confusing, and there are so many to choose from, so it will save time to locate them)..  The size .260-.375 worked perfectly on mine..  The compression connector looks more finished, and more importantly protects the extension cord from damage..  The type of compression fitting will be the one with a larger rubber chunk, rather than a little plastic or rubber ring only..\n\nFITTING TO CONNECT THE ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX:\nYou are going to have to piece things together here..\n~1~  Buy a 1/2 pipe nipple (that screws into the center hole on the DBL GANG BOX)..\n~2~  Buy a bag of 3 or more 1/2 - 3/4 reducing washers (in the electrical stuff)..\n~3~  Buy a standard lock washer..\n\nJUMPERS:\nBUY 14 GAUGE SOLID COPPER..\nYOU NEED: 1-green (or bare), 2 blacks 1-red and 1-white (a foot or a little less long.. I used about 8 inches)..  These wires are to extend from the DBL GANG BOX to the ETC BOX (JUMPERS)..  At home depot you can buy this wire by the foot..  First choice is to buy individual solid copper wires in all the colors you need..  Else buy a multi cable with several colors inside so all you need to do is cut it up (avoid buying stranded wires, unless you have a soldering iron needed to tin the ends.. because stranded and stranded don't do well together in the wire nut connectors)..\n\nIF YOU REALLY WANT TO SAVE $5-10 or so:\nDon't, LOL..  If you get extension and jumper wires both 14 gage, it will strong enough to handle \"all\" the current a 15A plugin can put out..  But, 20A fuses are sometimes found in kitchens too (and you would need 12 gage wire to handle a 20A ckt)..  But, the ETC in this application is only going to operate a FRIG..  So 16 gauge probably OK if you really really want to save a few dollars, because 16 gauge should be able to handle 13-14 AMPS, which I feel sure would be ok for a normal FRIG..  But as mentioned before 14 gauge will give you handle a large FRIG Should you choose inthe future, and dissipate heat better (which may be cheaper if this saves your ETC, or FRIG from a break down)..  Also, if you choose 16 gauge the compression fittings are finicky, and probably will not work, and these are a nice touch to doing a good job..\n\nFUSE:\nI did not add a fuse to mine..  You can add one if you want an additional layer of perfection and safety..  Typically commercial use things will have these fuses rather than home use things (I mean you would basically be putting a fuse on an extension cord, and who does that)..  Home depot did not have this part, or I might have picked one up..  They said to try fries, but maybe radio shack would have some kind of fuse..  I wanted something on the outside of the box like a fuse button, rather than a fusible link that would end up hidden in the DBL GANG BOX..  Wire the fuse in series with the black power wire coming from the plug-in side (series means cut the black wire only and add the fuse)..\n\nFEET (and screws):\nFEET (and screws):\nThe box will scratch the FRIG without these feet..  You will need 4-feet.. Get the rubber ones in the picture (you should be able to identify them at the store)..  Here is the story here..  I forced the sheet metal screws that came with the feet, and they barely worked..  The rubber starts to curl up (with screw about to pop thru the rubber which means the rubber falls off, just as the screw goes in deep enough to do its job)..  Since I already stripped the holes in mine, I will have to buy longer sheet metal screws, and then add the washers..\nDO THIS INSTEAD:\nDO NOT use the screws that come with the rubber feet..  Instead buy 4 screws (round head machine screw that fits in the DBL GANG BOX HOLE without stripping the threads)..  I do not know the exact screw size because I did not use these (just carry the box over to the hardware section and get the right screw)..  The length needs to be 3/4\" or longer (can be deep as the box allows)..  Also buy 4 washers (same size as the screw.. size #6 or #8.. I cant remember)..  POP the washers into the rubber so the screw doesnt pull thru (if the washers you find are too small, you can probably find other styles of washers that will work)..  Or, it may be easier to get sheet metal screws (and strip the threads out when you force them in), because these can be found with heads large enough to fit the rubber feet..\nNOTE: After all this screwing around with the feet, I ended up permanently mounting mine on the frig (so the feet are hanging in the air, LOL)..\n\nUSEFUL INFO:\nUSEFUL INFO:\nUSEFUL INFO:\n\nBLACK: hot (smaller slot on plug in).\nWHITE: neutral (larger slot in plug-in)..\nGROUND (bare or green):\n\nCONNECTOR BLOCKS INSIDE THE ETC:\nTHE UPPER RIGHT TERMINAL BLOCK:  Gets power from the house plug (white and black 120v where white is the common)..\n\nTHE LOWER LEFT TERMINAL BLOCK:  Is a simple relay that actuates according to the temp control setting of the ETC (the common terminal here is a hot=black wire jumper)..  When the relay actuates, the hot then gets connected to the NO (normally open) terminal which turns on the FRIG compressor (for this wiring setup)..  We connect the RED wire to the FRIG to the NO (middle) terminal..\n\nADD THE CONNECTORS TO THE ELEC BOXS:\nADD THE CONNECTORS TO THE ELEC BOXS:\nADD THE CONNECTORS TO THE ELEC BOXS:\n\nUSE THIS TECHNIQUE FOR ALL ELEC CONN:  Tighten by hand, then crank it with regular pliers until it is satisfyingly snug..  Generally the rule of thumb if to tighten it tight enough so that it is difficult if not impossible to remove by hand..\n\nCUT THE EXTENSION CORD:\nCut 10 foot from the end where the FRIG will plug in (so it will drape from the top of the FRIG to the floor (the other end of the extension cord drapes off the other side so it helps hold the ETC in place rather than dragging it off onto the floor)..  The remainder is 15 feet for the plug in end to hunt for an outlet (which really is not too long after it travels 5-8 feet down the side of the FRIG)..\n\nSTRIP THE SHEATH:\nThis is probably the trickiest part, because this is where you can screw up and \"easily\" cut to bare wire (\"really\" take your time here.. lightly score then pull and twist by hand to deepen the scores.. score a little more repeat)..  You have to remove about 6\" of the sheath from each end of the extension cord you cut (to break out the individual wires)..  How to  do this is to bend the whole cord sharply, then very carefully score with a razor blade/knife at the bend where there is stress on the casing (DO NOT CUT TOO DEEP (not even all the way thru the sheath covering) a simple score (think glass or diamond cutting) will make it so you can pull, and the casing should come off in your hand)..  You can carefully grip near the score mark with pliers, and sometime the sheath comes off easier this way..\n\nCUT UP THE JUMPERS:\nLocate the 14-gauge wires you bought, and simply cut up 2-BLACK, 1-WHITE, 1-RED, 1-GREEN or bare (you can strip all the insulation off one of the other colors to get a bare wire) ~~~ 10\" - 12\" long each (I cut mine a little short, and sure enough it made considerable more work for me)..  Strip the casing off only one end now (strip the 1/3 inch end only) to expose the copper wire (elec pliers make this part very easy; else this will be a little tedious with a razor blade.. if you don't have elec pliers, cut rather gently so you don't gouge the wire too bad (if you score and pull it somewhat works like removing the sheath above)..  One end should be 5/8 - 3/4 inch (strip these later as you wire), the other end should be about 1/3 inch..\n\nTIGHTEN EXTENSION CORD INTO COMPRESSION FITTINGS:\nOpen up the compression fitting (the parts get in the way so remove them now)..  Note the direction of the rubber piece (the cone shaped part of the rubber needs to meet the same cone shape metal)..  Screw the compression fittings into the already threaded holes 180 degrees apart on the DBL GANG BOX.  Warning, I scratched my box with the pliers (easy to do because the grip is so small)..  Crank with pliers until you can not budge them by hand..  Slide the pieces over the extension cord, and then insert the extension cord so the sheath extends into the DBL GANG BOX (MAKE SURE YOU PULL IN 8 INCHES LONG TOTAL INSIDE THE BOX, or it makes more work for you)..  Tighten with pliers and monitor so you know when the compression starts grabbing the wire..  Then keep tightening until you cannot pull it out by hand (you may need to tighten these quite a bit)..\n\nIF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH COMPRESSION FITTING:\nThese can be a PITA (good luck, they can be finicky), so first make sure you have the right size compression fitting (there are at least two sizes)..  If this fails too, I would try to insert a wire bet in a sharp V shape to take up more space inside the rubber compression part (but MAKE SURE THE COPPER IS OUTSIDE THE BOX.. in other words only the non conductive wire casing can be \"inside\" the elec box)..  Worst case scenario is to replace these with simple romex connectors (that look bad, and can break the casing of the extension cord; if you use this option, monitor to know when the ext cord snugs up in the fitting, and tweak it only a little more tight)..\n\nTHIS 180 DEGREE DESIGN WAS CHOSEN:\nTo allow us to drape the extension cord over the FRIG 180 degree apart, so the wires hanging over both sides of the FRIG will help hold the ETC in place rather than dragging it off onto the floor..\n\nATTACH ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX:\nATTACH ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX:\nATTACH ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX:\n\nWe need a little special care here for two reasons..  In the case of the plastic ETC box, if you get it too tight, it will weaken the plastic over time, and BAM, it may break apart later as the stress deteriorates the integrity of the plastic..  So tighten until its only a little snug and not wobbly (if a kid tried hard, they would be able to unscrew it by hand)..  When I tightened mine to the directions below, I noticed I was able to turn (adjust) the etc box, without the lock washer unscrewing itself, which is what you hope for)..  I think the washers made this lucky thing happen..  Second reason is we need a spacer BT the box's so that the casing of the ETC can be screwed back on without binding when done (and the etc can be adjusted to turn right or left without scraping the other box)..\n\nScrew the 1/2\" nipple into the center threaded hole on the back of the DBL GANG BOX..  I found a paper towel folded a lot, was enough to protect the threads from the pliers (if you don't protect the threads, it may be much more difficult to to do the final tightening later)..  Screw it in kind of tight (better to protrude more into the DBL GANG BOX)..\n\nHOW TO STACK THE WASHERS BETWEEN THE BOXES..  This is a little tricky, so find the picture I added to the main page of the ETC..  The caption in the PIC says the following: Copy this one exactly, so the lock washer will allow you to pivot the ETC without loosening the lock washer..  NOTE the 2 washers between the two boxes (the larger side of each washer is touching the other)..  Then the larger part of the washer inside the ETC box is touching the plastic.  The LOCK WASHER teeth point into the washer..\n\nThe reducing washers go against the plastic to protect the plastic from the lock washer teeth..  I am not sure which is best way to face these washers, but the exact way it was done in the picture works great.. The two washers between the BOXES separate them slightly (so the screws will not bind when attaching the ETC cover later)..\n\nIT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO TIGHTEN THE LOCK WASHER..  I felt lucky I was able to get my pliers on it..  If you cant tighten it with pliers, you can get a hammer and screwdriver (or punch) and tap on the lock washer to tighten it..\n\nI was able to turn my ETC to adjust which way I wanted it to face..  I did tighten it enough so it was kind of hard to turn..  It would be possible for a kid to keep twisting it in the same direction until it breaks the wires inside (kids can break anything though)..  With the larger DBL GANG BOX, and the combination of stranded wires used, you should be able to twist this thing back and fourth 180-360 degrees all you want with no damage to the wires (as the stranded are flexible)..  The only concern is that the metal lock washer might someday lose its lock and then the whole box would start to become lose and wobbly (no deal breaker, just open it up and tighten it.. or not)..\n\nWIRING THE ETC : informational:\nWIRING THE ETC : informational:\nWIRING THE ETC : informational:\n\nDont do this part yet (informational).  You need a small screwdriver to tighten the ETC screws..  We used a separate box (to make a base for the ETC to stand on) and because it will be much easier to slide wires to adjust the needed length into the ETC box (and have a much better feel when the wire is actually in the connector)..  Notice the length of the bare copper into the ETC BOX terminals..  Snip the copper all the same length so no more than 1/4\" of bare copper is visible, yet the copper is visible so you know the metal is clamping down on the wire..  Tighten these down (same technique; when wire is snug, tighten a little more than test that you cannot pull out the wires easily)..  This procedure helps you not break the etc terminal, which would kill your day until you could get a new ETC unit..\n\nTERMINAL SCREW NOTE:\nThe screws that tighten the wires in the ETC terminals are tricky..  You still turn the screwdriver clockwise to tighten, but expect the metal clamp to move \"up\" to clamp onto the wire..  What is tricky is that when you turn the screw counter clock wise to open up the hole, it appears above where you think it should be..\n\nIMPORTANT !!!\nIMPORTANT !!!\nIMPORTANT !!!\nBe careful when snipping wires (thorough this entire procedure) so that pieces of conductive copper do not end inside the electrical box's (this happens all the time, and this is very bad for obvious reasons)..  Little pieces of copper can short the main power.. And even the smallest little shard of a strand can easily burn out the $60 ETC electronics..\n\nHOW TO CONNECT THE WIRES:\nHOW TO CONNECT THE WIRES:\nHOW TO CONNECT THE WIRES:\n\nWait until you are installing the twist connector to strip the ends off the wires (because you typically snip the wires to the length you want at this point anyway)..\n\nIf any of the wires go to the ETC box then install the JUMPERS into the ETC terminal first (then gather the wires to install the twist connector)..  Strip the ends 1/3 inch, then stick the wire thru the hole into the ETC terminal and tighten down the screw..\n\nFind all the wires that will be wire tied together and cut to the same length (whatever length you feel is convenient to add the wire tie)..  Strip the wires and install the twist connector..\n\nALL SOLID COPPER JUMPERS TRAVEL FROM THE DBL GANG BOX INTO THE ETC BOX..\nUSE YELLOW TWIST CONNECTORS: for 2 wires..\nUSE ~ RED ~ TWIST CONNECTORS: for 3 wires..\n\nEVERY TIME YOU CONNECT A WIRE,\ninto a connector or terminal, \"monitor\" when the wires snug up by pulling lightly on the wire (or \"ALL\" the wires if a twist connector)..  When you find the wire (wires) are starting too hold together, then twist a few more times, then verify that the wires cannot be pulled out by hand..  This may sound tedious, but its easy, and if you dont, there will probably be a bad connection that will haunt you and make the equipment act flakey down the road..  I hate to suggest this, because tightening these twist connectors with your fingers is should be adequate..  But I cheat and \"gently\" hold all the wires with the pliers to get the last turn..  IF YOU DO THIS, MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT DAMAGE THE WIRE CASINGS (I guess you could add electrical tape if you need to)..\n\nHOW TO STRIP THE ENDS OF THE EXTENSION CORD WIRES:\nThe solid wires are easy to strip (so here is how to do the stranded ones)..  Strip to 3/4 inch (or a pinch longer because stranded wires pull up slightly when you tighten them)..  The elec pliers most people have are for solid copper, not stranded, so use one gauge larger to strip the ends (or you \"will\" shave off the copper strands of the wires)..  The plastic is usually soft on these, so you can swirl the wire in a circular shape (in the larger gauge hole of the pliers) to strip the ends..  If you only have a knife be extra careful stripping the ends because the thin strands are very easy to cut when you score..  Fortunately, the casing on these is usually easier to remove (so lightly score and pull with fingers usually works)..\n\nINSTALL CONNECTOR on :::::: SOLID:\nHold solid copper together with the ends even and twist the connector on..\n\nINSTALL CONNECTOR on :::::: SOLID TO STRANDED:\nThese are a little trickier..  Twist each individual stranded wire tip to make it act more like a solid wire..  When you hold the ends together to attach the twist connector, the ends of the stranded should be slightly longer than the copper, slightly overlapping (longer than the solid) but we are only talking 1/16 inch (or less)..  Solid to stranded is trickier, so if it fails (you find you can pull it out with your fingers), try again (until you can not pull the wires out by hand)..  There is extra length in the wires, so it it fails twice, then cut off the frayed ends (1 inch), and try again..\n\nBEGIN ACTUAL WIRING CONNECTIONS:\nBEGIN ACTUAL WIRING CONNECTIONS:\nBEGIN ACTUAL WIRING CONNECTIONS:\n\n-1-  CONNECT GROUND WIRE IN DBL GANG BOX:\nLocate the green screw that came with the box (you can find the screw hole location in the pictures for this item)..  This screw will cut its own threads when you screw it into the hole (which makes a sure electrical connection)..  Wrap the copper wire around the screw in a semi circle around the screw (bend circle in the direction so that tightening the screw will tend to close the circle rather than open it)..

You can simply go back and buy the exact same size screw that came with the feet (sheet metal screw), but at least 1/2 inch longer..  This will probably work without washers, because with a longer screw you will not need to over tighten (which then pops the rubber feet off the screws) to secure the cover, and the head will be larger too..

I actually didn't buy a replacement for the leaking but because the plastic bracket holding the separate cleaning solution container broke and the container would no longer stay in place and the machine could not be used without it in place.  Like others, I agree that this container is better designed with the cleaning solution container molded into the main water container with a sturdier design than the way the bracket for the cleaning solution was designed for the old one.  I am not sure if something has changed with the way they sell this or it is dependent on the seller (as I got mine from a third party seller FBA) but my replacement steamvac container has the handle, seals, and lids included.  I was reading the reviews and was concerned that there would be no handle so I held onto my old container but to my relief the old handle was not needed.\n\nThis fit perfectly onto my machine but I initially thought I had a problem with my steamvac as when I first used this with the new container in place, I noticed I wasn't getting as much water up from the carpet as I was with my old container.  I then realized that my old container was leaking so badly that I was using the water so much faster as it was spilling onto the carpet and therefore being sucked up by the machine.  So the seals in both the caps and the bottom area that connects into the machine are much better than the old design.\n\nThe tank itself is a solid thicker plastic than my old one and appears to be better made overall.  Like others have indicated the openings for the solution and water is flat with a locking cap as opposed to having a lipped top with the lid screwing onto that.  Maybe that creates a better seal with the caps but it does make it a bit harder to deal with when filling up and emptying.\n\nMy one issue with this is the cost which I think is a bit pricey but this is cheaper here than from the manufacturer which is around 20 dollars more.\n\nIt works and it an improvement over the old container.\n\n4 stars","summary":"Better than the original container and mine came with the handle","unixReviewTime":1456531200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_160"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Hi2+VrI-L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"3","verified":true,"reviewTime":"11 19, 2014","reviewerID":"A2WIIPLMWSJY8T","asin":"B0017VHI38","style":{"Size:":" 1 count","Color:":" Frosted Ice"},"reviewerName":"MadamMorgan","reviewText":"Exactly what I needed for my nursing bag.

Having owned these for almost a year now and in side by side comparisons I'm finding there to be a one point difference for humidity between the two units ( close and certainly not a deal breaker) and temperature tends to read equal for both. On the back is a white button to change from Celsius to Fahrenheit as well as a magnetic clip. The readout is a nice legible size with 24 hour highs and lows recorded for both humidity and temperature. What I don't like is these units cannot be calibrated. Also, I puchased two and one arrived with a damaged clip. Not the fault of AcuRite. A suggestion I have is to check for accuracy by conducting the salt test. Place salt in the bottle cap (or other small container). Dampen the salt with water. Place both the hygrometer and the bottle cap full of damp salt in a ziploc bag and seal. Keep it like this for  8+ hours.  After 8+ hours the humidity inside the bag will be 75%. Compare it to your hygrometer which should read 75%. If it's off, note how much and in which direction then be sure to add or subtract that amount when reading the hygrometer. Hope this helps.","summary":"Check for accuracy.

Ive changed the Amazon Basics AA battery once, which I do with most of my battery-operated products every 6 or 12 months (especially with smoke detectors/alarms). I don't wait for batteries to die. I appreciate how quickly the readings are available. For instance, I can walk from one part of my first floor home to the other, and see the difference in temperature and humidity readings within seconds. The digital numbers are easy to read as long as I have on my glasses and Im not in the dark. Theres a tiny white button located on the back that les you choose Fahrenheit or Celsius. I would definitely buy this Acurite model again*. I paid $3 more in 2016.\n\nHOW ACCURATE ARE THE READINGS? I can tell if the readings are accurate by comparing different areas of my home where it is obvious (see messy images) that the humidity is really high. In Miami, FL, I doubt Ill ever witness a really low humidity reading room in my old home.  I have a large window that needs to be replaced (the whole darn thing, glass and frame). It allows outside weather conditions (heat and more heat) to seep right into my home. Yep, already added that ugly and cheap plastic sheeting over the frame, but its not helping enough.\n\nWHY I BOUGHT THIS: I use this meter, mostly it seems, just to annoy myself. LOL!  Im not using for growing indoor plants or any other casually scientific reason. I just like to know why I feel like crapnothing escapes the effects of dampness in the air, the dampness that can easily make me feel miserable, the dampness that requires me to cleanly wipe down even more crap. On a positive note, its easy to turn on the air conditioner (sometimes using the free air circulation) to help reduce these issues. Until I can find a person willing to empty bins of water for me every single day, I cant be bothered with dehumidifiers. Nobody in their right mind leaves stagnant water in Miami (mosquitos will find it).\n\nFor those trying to learn the most basic humidity examples: Very low humidity can cause dry skin, nosebleeds, and who knows what else.

Casto","reviewText":"This stuff is an amazing build surface. I love not having to mess with glue sticks or hairspray any more. However there's a few things to be aware of concerning the adhesive and application. First of all, I'd recommend getting a size larger than needed. Often times beds are oddly shaped (200x213) or the PEI is undersized. It's easy enough to trim and not too much more to just get a size up and cut it back. With this particular product - or at least the 0.03\" thickness - one side is gloss while the other is matte. I wanted to point that out because I've bought PEI from other suppliers on here that was glossy on both sides. The color of this product is a nice deep amber (see photos).\n\nNow concerning application in general.... if you've never worked with 3M 468MP adhesive before, it's kind of a gooey nightmare. It's basically the stuff that is used to stick credit cards or gift cards to the paper, but a whole sheet of it. The first time I did it I figured applying it like you would a screen protector would work. That worked great to make sure it was straight and dust-free, but what I didn't anticipate was how bad it traps air bubbles, and unlike a screen protector you can't really work them out afterwards. While the PEI was rigid enough to lay flat over the large bubbles at bed temps up to 50C, any higher than that and the air in the bubbles would expand and visibly distort the surface. So while I was able to get away with printing PLA and PETG, ABS could have been problematic. I did some research and decided to order some more adhesive and try again.\n\nRemoving the adhesive is a pain, but not too bad if you're patient and persistent. The best bet to separate the PEI from the glass to use something like the long thin spatula tools used to help remove prints from the bed. You can work it into the adhesive and slowly scrape/pry things apart. After that the easiest way to get the adhesive itself off is to rub and roll it around so the goo snowballs up and helps pull more off. The glass will usually clean up pretty easy and clean and can be polished up with some rubbing alcohol. The PEI on the other hand is a little more difficult to get clean. I rubbed most of the adhesive off with the aid of a little Goo Gone. Once I had it down to just a thin layer of adhesive residue I was able to use rubbing alcohol and a Magic Eraser to clean it up the rest of the way. Just note that the Magic Eraser will abraid the PEI a slight bit. I liked the look, but some may not.\n\nNow the trick to applying this stuff is to use pressure as you go so that air can't get trapped. It's not enough to just bend it up and roll it on like you would a screen protector, you have to use something (I used a spackle knife) to work it down and forward. I found the best way was to peel up the starting edge of the wax paper and get things lined up, then work your way forward, pulling the paper out as you go. The curl in the paper will help to keep the adhesive sheet up and away from the glass. After that you can look through the glass to find any air bubbles. It can help to take a pin or x-acto and pop the bubbles and try to work the air out. I also found it helpful to put the glass on the heated bed and bring it up to working temp to see what bubbles show up as the air expands. Hitting them with a pin at this point will let the heat push some of the air out. Remember to do all this before applying the PEI though.\n\nThe process for applying the PEI without bubbles is similar to the adhesive, but it being more rigid makes it a bit easier to do. Just use your fingers to press down and rub it as you work your way forward and it should be fine. If you bought a larger size then now would be the perfect time to flip it over, score, and snap off the excess. After that you should be good to go. One trick I've learned for printing with PEI is that rubbing alcohol and a Magic Eraser work great for cleaning in between prints","summary":"The perfect build surface.

Originally I have tried phenolic paper that is similar to this PEI sheet of plastic but not quite. I was having a good amount of luck with the phenolic paper sheet but was still having problems with small parts from sticking on to the build plate. I also heard someone talking about how polyetherimide works very well to stick prints down. So I decided to buy a sheet of 12 by 12.\n\nThe polyetherimide sheet came in a box without any reinforcements this was a little problematic since the box was warped and crushed. The sheet of polyetherimide was slightly warped but is not too much of a big deal since I am sticking it to my build plate with adhesives. The sheet had plastic protective films on both sides of the sheet. This had protected the finish of the sheet and I was happy about this. Also they placed the product sticker on the protective film instead of directly to the product kudos to them. That simple decision saved me some time from picking at the sticker. Also if you were wondering the sheet is a slight transparent yellow color.\n\nAs for the quality of the polyetherimide sheet the material that it's made from is of good quality. But the the sheet of polyetherimide was a little smaller than the advertised 12 by 12. If you are trying to build something with this I would recommend you buy a slightly bigger sheet then what you need since it won't be exactly the size that you buy. Its very important for 3d printer beds to be flat to insure correct measurements and good adhesion. The sheet of polyetherimide thickness ranged from 1.1 mm, 0.92 mm, 0.93 mm, to 1.07 mm. This is not too great but still a workable tolerance.\n\nNow for the important part does it function better than the phenolic paper that i'm currently using? After testing it with my printer for a little while I can say that the polyetherimide sheet did in fact perform better than phenolic paper that I was was using previously. The parts seem to stick a little better and like the other sheet you can clean it with rubbing alcohol.\n\nSo if you're into 3D printing and are looking for ways to improve your 3D print well this is certainly something that you should consider to try out. But it's not a 100% foolproof fix, it's just a very close one. So what are you waiting for go out there and try it.","summary":"Good Material For A Build Plate","unixReviewTime":1471219200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_205"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ImKb0KejL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61WVDOP0bLL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"214","verified":true,"reviewTime":"06 11, 2011","reviewerID":"A2D1LPEUCTNT8X","asin":"B0013U75B8","style":{"Size:":" Medium","Style:":" Box of 100"},"reviewerName":"Ali Julia","reviewText":"<div id=\"video-block-RRCUCMJXGZGCL\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wsuy0TobS.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UwZoN1upS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">I am very grateful to other reviewers for indicating that these gloves run small.

I am attaching several photos to show how the glove fits my hand.\n\nThe glove is  tight in the palm area (you can see the photo shows it stretched and taught). When I make a fist I feel resistance. The finger tips of this medium size glove are bit too long, the second picture shows me holding my hand in the glove against the box so you can see the extra material folding over at the tips.  This is not too bad, and will not interfere with the kind of work I plan to use them for.\n\nThe glove material is thicker than the gloves I used before, which is good. I did not detect strong ordor either on the gloves or on my hands after I removed them. I was able to put the gloves on and off a few times for the photo, they became a little harder to put on with each use (less slippery).  Even though these gloves are powder free there was something on the inside of the glove that made it easier to put on the first time.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with the gloves and so glad there were reviews that helped me pick the right size!","summary":"Nice gloves, but they run small in size - details within","unixReviewTime":1307750400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_206"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71butqHLIPL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":3,"vote":"17","verified":true,"reviewTime":"01 15, 2015","reviewerID":"A256J4OJ7LAZ7B","asin":"B0015DLMOO","reviewerName":"Nigel","reviewText":"These are SUPER uncomfortable in your ears!!!!!

I did this as an after thought, and have a ton of regrets on the \"mounting\" design pictured (so I can tell you a whole bunch of ways to improve on this)..  The mount is simple PVC plastic plumbing pipes (used one step spray paint made for plastic and metal, $4)..  First, don't do the complicated \"F\" shape (shape of the assembled pipes) with all the \"T\" fittings and elbows I used (because you cant thread the thermostat thru the fittings, and they are unnecessary anyway)..  If you look at the picture, note that I used T fittings to make it stand off the FRIG an inch or so..  This added a lot of complication for no reason whatsoever..  FOR YOURs simple make a F, or C shape with 1\" PVC pipes, and the part that touches the frig will be nothing but a pipe (no fittings on it)..  Drill hole thru pipes for mounting (drill pilot hole thru frig sheet metal, then use sheet metal screws..\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nThere is always the possability you could damage your FRIG drilling thru it..  You would be taking that chance..  I drilled away from the electrical stuff on the frig (and drilled thru insulation as I expected)..\n\nTIPS:\nUSE 1\" PVC:  I used 3/4, and its way too wiggly..  1\" should work better.. PVC is strong, and 1\" should be large enough to thread the thermostat thru..  You will need reducer to 1/2\" at the end to mount the box with 1/2 nipple)..  Dont mix the thermostat line with electrical wires (you can do it, but dont)..  INSTEAD of saving $2 on the 3 hole box (down on the shopping list), get the box with more holes..  Try to use T fittings where the thermostat will get threaded thru (may not fit thru an elbow)..\n\nF SHAPE:\nUse (F upside down) if you have a short FRIG, and you want to mount the etc higher (mine is an F)..  You can add a T fitting hear the top to have a place to run the thermostat wire (or drill a hole thru the pipe)..\n\nC SHAPE:\nOn a  tall FRIG, get two 1/2 plastic male thread fittings, and glue them to male two identical L shapes (of PVV pipes)..  Assemble them to the box and you have a C shape (ready to mount to FRIG)..\n\nTHERMOSTAT:\nRun it thru the PVC pipes..  It doesnt have to be concealed completely like a commercial application..  In the pic you can see mine hanging over the top then entering the pipes.. I used rubber hose (drilled out so the thermostat would fit)..  Drilling out a rubber hose turned out to be a lot of work.. I am not sure what to tell you here for drilling a hole thru the FRIG to mount the thermostat inside FRIG..  But if you do not have some way to protect the thermostat wire from the sharp metal in the hole we will drill, it will probably eventually fail and short circuit)..  Using a rubber hose was a pain..  You might try finding a plastic hose (so the inside would be bigger).. But the outside of the hose will be the size of the hole you need to drill..  Then simply slide the protective hose thru the hole (thermostat wire goes thru the hose)..  My  rubber hose is holding itself in place  by luck..  You may need some kind of caulk or something to hold the protective hose in place (maybe a dash inside the hose too to help keep the cold air inside)..  I would use silicone (not sure what is food safe.. probably none of the caulks are for food contact..\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~ end UPD\n\nUPDATE:  080711:\n\nPlugged mine in and it works perfectly..  I remember getting hung up on the long wire to drape over both sides of the FRIG..  Silly me, LOL I have a freezer chest..  At least the long wires on both sides will give me the wire I need to put it somewhere convenient (so I still firmly believe longer wires are better than getting stuck too short)..  I wish now I would have paid $2 more for a box with more holes, then I could have easily attached the box to the rear of the freezer and place it at eye level with 3 pieces of water pipe..  Hell, maybe I could use the same mounting pipe to conceal the thermostat probe (drill a hole into the freezer box that enters exactly where the pipe attaches)..\n\nend: RANCO ETC UPDATE:  080711:\nend: RANCO ETC UPDATE:  080711:\n\nI strongly suggest printing this out if you want to follow this procedure..  I tried to lay it out linear (do it from start to finish)..  Take the printout with you for the shopping list..\n\nI was unable to add pictures directly to this review, but I was able to add pictures to the main page for the ranco ETC.. I will note in the text below when to look at a picture..\n\nI bought a \"freezer\" chest because when you open it the cold air stays in (condensation is reduced, and energy efficiency increased)..  The disadvantage is if you are doing wine or beer and its too heavy for you to lift out..  Also, I got a freezer specifically, so I can use it as either a FRIG \"or\" freezer later using the ETC control if I choose..\n\nI am elated there exists such a device for people like me that want to optimize flavor fermenting sauerkraut and for winemaking / beer brewing..  So, here is detailed help for anyone intimidated about wiring their own.. I will monitor for questions or corrections that may need to be made (but amazon takes a day or two to post corrections)..  Unfortunately this has become \"very\" verbose in an attempt to me more clear .. My goal was to give the ability to wire the ETC, to the complete electrical novice..  But people who already know how to wire should skim thru for the tips to wire it perfectly (the only thing I left off was a fuse; which if you want commercial quality, simply add a 15A fuse into the ckt)..  These notes are on details that are not in the directions that came with the rancho etc, but someone who knows how to do wiring could figure it out..  I am an avid tinkerer of things, so I think I can take the mystery out of how to wire it, and set it up for actual commercial use instead of hoping it works..  There is a shopping list below, of things you already need to buy; so adding $10-20 to the total cost is money well spent to do a fantastic job over a mediocre job (so plan on buying $40 worth of electrical parts, instead of $20-25?)..  When wired optimally, the heavier gauge wires will dissipate heat better which protects the sensitive electronics, and allows you to later hook the rancho etc up to a very large FRIG if you decide to, because you used higher capacity wiring..  And paying $18 instead of $12 for the extension cord sets you up so you don't need to use yet another extension cord later if the plug in is too far away, and gives you the slack you need to plug the FRIG in without pulling the ETC off the FRIG..\n\nI HOPE I DONT GET  A LEMON:\nAs some reviewers complained..  Perhaps they installed this wiring incorrectly (there are ways to screw it up)..  Perhaps the probe was damaged (it is replaceable I believe)..  Common sense says the probe should be near what you want to control,and not in a corner so it will be open to circulating air..  I do not know if we would be better off putting the probe right on the crock... Because I feel TEMP probes tend to be delicate..  Also, see the BULLETIN below about TEMP swings, and compressor protection (this could be another area where people may be having problems)..  Yet another thing that can go wrong is if pieces of copper wire get into the box when wiring it up (you need to \"know\" where the little pieces went when clipping the wires)..\n\nCOMPRESSOR PROTECTION ?\nETC NOT WORKING PROPERLY ?\n\nREAD THIS IF YOU WANT TO maximize the lifespan of your FRIG (or if the FRIG is not holding the TEMP range the ETC setting is calling for)..  Some troubles may \"not\" be the fault of the ETC, rather the limited capability of the FRIG itself..  The ETC has no ability to control the compressor cycle time (protect the compressor from damage by turning on too soon after it just ran)..  My first thought was that the FRIG controls would already have this protection function built into its own controls if needed..  But perhaps this is the reason for some of the negative reviews (and no one realized what is happening)..  Few people are complaining, and I saw no complaints of a broken FRIG (although this sort of thing may shorten the life of the FRIG (or it may not; I am choosing to risk it myself)..  I imagine (I don't really know), depending on the design of the refrigerator, the FRIG temp range swing might be part of that protection design (in this particular case, we would have a problem), because the ETC indeed does \"force\" onto the FRIG a new TEMP RANGE..  The ETC can be set to control within 1-DEGREE, which I doubt any FRIG will do on its own..  The ETC is an electrical relay that functions like kid plugging, then unplugging the FRIG frequently to keep the TEMP range setting..  If you are curious, or have a problem with the TEMP control, I suggest you put the ETC temp probe in the FRIG, but do not control the FRIG with the ETC..  Then simply watch the TEMP range (I \"think\" you can check the temp this way) to see how the FRIG was designed to operate (if not broken, which the ETC could not cure anyway)..  Then add the ETC back to control the FRIG TEMP..  And tweak back the ETC setting a degree or two tighter (IE: control the TEMP range swing not to 1 or 2 degrees, but closer to the temp swings that the FRIG wants to do on its own), and then you will see if the problem goes away (if it does go away, you can tighten up the ETC temp range one more degree at a time and you will eventually know how far you can push your FRIG)..\nWHY 1 DEGREE TEMP RANGE ANYWAY:\nFor SAUER KRAUT I plan to use 3 degrees range to keep the TEMP exactly in the TEMP range given by Harsch (minus 1 degree colder to account for the possible spontaneous heating of the crock caused by fermentation).. I feel there is no reason to keep the temp so tightly controlled, because TEMP swings are common in nature..  But, I am interested if anyone has any theories that the end result might taste better..  MY KRAUT: 2-3 days at 20-22C (68-72), then 15-18C (59-64 F.) for 4-6 weeks..\n\nWiring the ETC according to these directions sets everything up to put the ETC control on tof of the frig (but alternately you can put it somewhere else because there will be a longish cord on either end..\n\nTOOLS:\nTOOLS:\nTOOLS:\n\nScrewdriver, electrical pliers, regular pliers too, knife or razor (and you can get by with a knife if you do not have electrical pliers, but you will still need wire cutters.. an old fingernail cutter will probably work to get a clean snip)..  You will need a smaller than normal screwdriver, because a full size one will not fit the ETC..\n\nSHOPPING LIST:\nSHOPPING LIST:\nSHOPPING LIST:\n\n25 FOOT 14 GAGUE EXTENSION CORD:\nYou are spending $6 more for this longer heavier cord..  A little too long is always better than too short..  I strongly suggest you buy an extension cord as close to this one as you can (because the compression connectors and finicky.. the round diameter of the cord is what is needed to make it work)..  I bought a HUSKY, round medium duty indoor/outdoor 14 gauge extension cord..  14 GAUGE is the same wire gauge a 15a house wiring uses, so it should easily handle any FRIG as a load (rather than overloading which leads to premature failure of electrical devices, or possibly fire)..\n\nDBL GANG (SQUARE) OUTDOOR ELECTRICAL BOX: (and cover):\nCosts $9-10..  Get 1/2 inch size (refers to holes in box)..  Also get a plain square metal cover..  Get 3 hole (cheaper)..  NOTE: if you are planning to install to frig, get the box with more holes..\n\nELECTRICAL CONNECTORS:\n3 RED twist ties, and 2 YELLOW twist tie connectors..  The ones with the little wings are easier to use..\n\nCOMPRESSION FITTINGS:\nBuy two of these (one for each cut end of the extension cord..  See the notes for the extension cord to buy (above)..  I suggest you ask the store clerk for help with the connectors (because the compression fittings can be confusing, and there are so many to choose from, so it will save time to locate them)..  The size .260-.375 worked perfectly on mine..  The compression connector looks more finished, and more importantly protects the extension cord from damage..  The type of compression fitting will be the one with a larger rubber chunk, rather than a little plastic or rubber ring only..\n\nFITTING TO CONNECT THE ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX:\nYou are going to have to piece things together here..\n~1~  Buy a 1/2 pipe nipple (that screws into the center hole on the DBL GANG BOX)..\n~2~  Buy a bag of 3 or more 1/2 - 3/4 reducing washers (in the electrical stuff)..\n~3~  Buy a standard lock washer..\n\nJUMPERS:\nBUY 14 GAUGE SOLID COPPER..\nYOU NEED: 1-green (or bare), 2 blacks 1-red and 1-white (a foot or a little less long.. I used about 8 inches)..  These wires are to extend from the DBL GANG BOX to the ETC BOX (JUMPERS)..  At home depot you can buy this wire by the foot..  First choice is to buy individual solid copper wires in all the colors you need..  Else buy a multi cable with several colors inside so all you need to do is cut it up (avoid buying stranded wires, unless you have a soldering iron needed to tin the ends.. because stranded and stranded don't do well together in the wire nut connectors)..\n\nIF YOU REALLY WANT TO SAVE $5-10 or so:\nDon't, LOL..  If you get extension and jumper wires both 14 gage, it will strong enough to handle \"all\" the current a 15A plugin can put out..  But, 20A fuses are sometimes found in kitchens too (and you would need 12 gage wire to handle a 20A ckt)..  But, the ETC in this application is only going to operate a FRIG..  So 16 gauge probably OK if you really really want to save a few dollars, because 16 gauge should be able to handle 13-14 AMPS, which I feel sure would be ok for a normal FRIG..  But as mentioned before 14 gauge will give you handle a large FRIG Should you choose inthe future, and dissipate heat better (which may be cheaper if this saves your ETC, or FRIG from a break down)..  Also, if you choose 16 gauge the compression fittings are finicky, and probably will not work, and these are a nice touch to doing a good job..\n\nFUSE:\nI did not add a fuse to mine..  You can add one if you want an additional layer of perfection and safety..  Typically commercial use things will have these fuses rather than home use things (I mean you would basically be putting a fuse on an extension cord, and who does that)..  Home depot did not have this part, or I might have picked one up..  They said to try fries, but maybe radio shack would have some kind of fuse..  I wanted something on the outside of the box like a fuse button, rather than a fusible link that would end up hidden in the DBL GANG BOX..  Wire the fuse in series with the black power wire coming from the plug-in side (series means cut the black wire only and add the fuse)..\n\nFEET (and screws):\nFEET (and screws):\nThe box will scratch the FRIG without these feet..  You will need 4-feet.. Get the rubber ones in the picture (you should be able to identify them at the store)..  Here is the story here..  I forced the sheet metal screws that came with the feet, and they barely worked..  The rubber starts to curl up (with screw about to pop thru the rubber which means the rubber falls off, just as the screw goes in deep enough to do its job)..  Since I already stripped the holes in mine, I will have to buy longer sheet metal screws, and then add the washers..\nDO THIS INSTEAD:\nDO NOT use the screws that come with the rubber feet..  Instead buy 4 screws (round head machine screw that fits in the DBL GANG BOX HOLE without stripping the threads)..  I do not know the exact screw size because I did not use these (just carry the box over to the hardware section and get the right screw)..  The length needs to be 3/4\" or longer (can be deep as the box allows)..  Also buy 4 washers (same size as the screw.. size #6 or #8.. I cant remember)..  POP the washers into the rubber so the screw doesnt pull thru (if the washers you find are too small, you can probably find other styles of washers that will work)..  Or, it may be easier to get sheet metal screws (and strip the threads out when you force them in), because these can be found with heads large enough to fit the rubber feet..\nNOTE: After all this screwing around with the feet, I ended up permanently mounting mine on the frig (so the feet are hanging in the air, LOL)..\n\nUSEFUL INFO:\nUSEFUL INFO:\nUSEFUL INFO:\n\nBLACK: hot (smaller slot on plug in).\nWHITE: neutral (larger slot in plug-in)..\nGROUND (bare or green):\n\nCONNECTOR BLOCKS INSIDE THE ETC:\nTHE UPPER RIGHT TERMINAL BLOCK:  Gets power from the house plug (white and black 120v where white is the common)..\n\nTHE LOWER LEFT TERMINAL BLOCK:  Is a simple relay that actuates according to the temp control setting of the ETC (the common terminal here is a hot=black wire jumper)..  When the relay actuates, the hot then gets connected to the NO (normally open) terminal which turns on the FRIG compressor (for this wiring setup)..  We connect the RED wire to the FRIG to the NO (middle) terminal..\n\nADD THE CONNECTORS TO THE ELEC BOXS:\nADD THE CONNECTORS TO THE ELEC BOXS:\nADD THE CONNECTORS TO THE ELEC BOXS:\n\nUSE THIS TECHNIQUE FOR ALL ELEC CONN:  Tighten by hand, then crank it with regular pliers until it is satisfyingly snug..  Generally the rule of thumb if to tighten it tight enough so that it is difficult if not impossible to remove by hand..\n\nCUT THE EXTENSION CORD:\nCut 10 foot from the end where the FRIG will plug in (so it will drape from the top of the FRIG to the floor (the other end of the extension cord drapes off the other side so it helps hold the ETC in place rather than dragging it off onto the floor)..  The remainder is 15 feet for the plug in end to hunt for an outlet (which really is not too long after it travels 5-8 feet down the side of the FRIG)..\n\nSTRIP THE SHEATH:\nThis is probably the trickiest part, because this is where you can screw up and \"easily\" cut to bare wire (\"really\" take your time here.. lightly score then pull and twist by hand to deepen the scores.. score a little more repeat)..  You have to remove about 6\" of the sheath from each end of the extension cord you cut (to break out the individual wires)..  How to  do this is to bend the whole cord sharply, then very carefully score with a razor blade/knife at the bend where there is stress on the casing (DO NOT CUT TOO DEEP (not even all the way thru the sheath covering) a simple score (think glass or diamond cutting) will make it so you can pull, and the casing should come off in your hand)..  You can carefully grip near the score mark with pliers, and sometime the sheath comes off easier this way..\n\nCUT UP THE JUMPERS:\nLocate the 14-gauge wires you bought, and simply cut up 2-BLACK, 1-WHITE, 1-RED, 1-GREEN or bare (you can strip all the insulation off one of the other colors to get a bare wire) ~~~ 10\" - 12\" long each (I cut mine a little short, and sure enough it made considerable more work for me)..  Strip the casing off only one end now (strip the 1/3 inch end only) to expose the copper wire (elec pliers make this part very easy; else this will be a little tedious with a razor blade.. if you don't have elec pliers, cut rather gently so you don't gouge the wire too bad (if you score and pull it somewhat works like removing the sheath above)..  One end should be 5/8 - 3/4 inch (strip these later as you wire), the other end should be about 1/3 inch..\n\nTIGHTEN EXTENSION CORD INTO COMPRESSION FITTINGS:\nOpen up the compression fitting (the parts get in the way so remove them now)..  Note the direction of the rubber piece (the cone shaped part of the rubber needs to meet the same cone shape metal)..  Screw the compression fittings into the already threaded holes 180 degrees apart on the DBL GANG BOX.  Warning, I scratched my box with the pliers (easy to do because the grip is so small)..  Crank with pliers until you can not budge them by hand..  Slide the pieces over the extension cord, and then insert the extension cord so the sheath extends into the DBL GANG BOX (MAKE SURE YOU PULL IN 8 INCHES LONG TOTAL INSIDE THE BOX, or it makes more work for you)..  Tighten with pliers and monitor so you know when the compression starts grabbing the wire..  Then keep tightening until you cannot pull it out by hand (you may need to tighten these quite a bit)..\n\nIF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH COMPRESSION FITTING:\nThese can be a PITA (good luck, they can be finicky), so first make sure you have the right size compression fitting (there are at least two sizes)..  If this fails too, I would try to insert a wire bet in a sharp V shape to take up more space inside the rubber compression part (but MAKE SURE THE COPPER IS OUTSIDE THE BOX.. in other words only the non conductive wire casing can be \"inside\" the elec box)..  Worst case scenario is to replace these with simple romex connectors (that look bad, and can break the casing of the extension cord; if you use this option, monitor to know when the ext cord snugs up in the fitting, and tweak it only a little more tight)..\n\nTHIS 180 DEGREE DESIGN WAS CHOSEN:\nTo allow us to drape the extension cord over the FRIG 180 degree apart, so the wires hanging over both sides of the FRIG will help hold the ETC in place rather than dragging it off onto the floor..\n\nATTACH ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX:\nATTACH ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX:\nATTACH ETC TO THE DBL GANG BOX:\n\nWe need a little special care here for two reasons..  In the case of the plastic ETC box, if you get it too tight, it will weaken the plastic over time, and BAM, it may break apart later as the stress deteriorates the integrity of the plastic..  So tighten until its only a little snug and not wobbly (if a kid tried hard, they would be able to unscrew it by hand)..  When I tightened mine to the directions below, I noticed I was able to turn (adjust) the etc box, without the lock washer unscrewing itself, which is what you hope for)..  I think the washers made this lucky thing happen..  Second reason is we need a spacer BT the box's so that the casing of the ETC can be screwed back on without binding when done (and the etc can be adjusted to turn right or left without scraping the other box)..\n\nScrew the 1/2\" nipple into the center threaded hole on the back of the DBL GANG BOX..  I found a paper towel folded a lot, was enough to protect the threads from the pliers (if you don't protect the threads, it may be much more difficult to to do the final tightening later)..  Screw it in kind of tight (better to protrude more into the DBL GANG BOX)..\n\nHOW TO STACK THE WASHERS BETWEEN THE BOXES..  This is a little tricky, so find the picture I added to the main page of the ETC..  The caption in the PIC says the following: Copy this one exactly, so the lock washer will allow you to pivot the ETC without loosening the lock washer..  NOTE the 2 washers between the two boxes (the larger side of each washer is touching the other)..  Then the larger part of the washer inside the ETC box is touching the plastic.  The LOCK WASHER teeth point into the washer..\n\nThe reducing washers go against the plastic to protect the plastic from the lock washer teeth..  I am not sure which is best way to face these washers, but the exact way it was done in the picture works great.. The two washers between the BOXES separate them slightly (so the screws will not bind when attaching the ETC cover later)..\n\nIT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO TIGHTEN THE LOCK WASHER..  I felt lucky I was able to get my pliers on it..  If you cant tighten it with pliers, you can get a hammer and screwdriver (or punch) and tap on the lock washer to tighten it..\n\nI was able to turn my ETC to adjust which way I wanted it to face..  I did tighten it enough so it was kind of hard to turn..  It would be possible for a kid to keep twisting it in the same direction until it breaks the wires inside (kids can break anything though)..  With the larger DBL GANG BOX, and the combination of stranded wires used, you should be able to twist this thing back and fourth 180-360 degrees all you want with no damage to the wires (as the stranded are flexible)..  The only concern is that the metal lock washer might someday lose its lock and then the whole box would start to become lose and wobbly (no deal breaker, just open it up and tighten it.. or not)..\n\nWIRING THE ETC : informational:\nWIRING THE ETC : informational:\nWIRING THE ETC : informational:\n\nDont do this part yet (informational).  You need a small screwdriver to tighten the ETC screws..  We used a separate box (to make a base for the ETC to stand on) and because it will be much easier to slide wires to adjust the needed length into the ETC box (and have a much better feel when the wire is actually in the connector)..  Notice the length of the bare copper into the ETC BOX terminals..  Snip the copper all the same length so no more than 1/4\" of bare copper is visible, yet the copper is visible so you know the metal is clamping down on the wire..  Tighten these down (same technique; when wire is snug, tighten a little more than test that you cannot pull out the wires easily)..  This procedure helps you not break the etc terminal, which would kill your day until you could get a new ETC unit..\n\nTERMINAL SCREW NOTE:\nThe screws that tighten the wires in the ETC terminals are tricky..  You still turn the screwdriver clockwise to tighten, but expect the metal clamp to move \"up\" to clamp onto the wire..  What is tricky is that when you turn the screw counter clock wise to open up the hole, it appears above where you think it should be..\n\nIMPORTANT !!!\nIMPORTANT !!!\nIMPORTANT !!!\nBe careful when snipping wires (thorough this entire procedure) so that pieces of conductive copper do not end inside the electrical box's (this happens all the time, and this is very bad for obvious reasons)..  Little pieces of copper can short the main power.. And even the smallest little shard of a strand can easily burn out the $60 ETC electronics..\n\nHOW TO CONNECT THE WIRES:\nHOW TO CONNECT THE WIRES:\nHOW TO CONNECT THE WIRES:\n\nWait until you are installing the twist connector to strip the ends off the wires (because you typically snip the wires to the length you want at this point anyway)..\n\nIf any of the wires go to the ETC box then install the JUMPERS into the ETC terminal first (then gather the wires to install the twist connector)..  Strip the ends 1/3 inch, then stick the wire thru the hole into the ETC terminal and tighten down the screw..\n\nFind all the wires that will be wire tied together and cut to the same length (whatever length you feel is convenient to add the wire tie)..  Strip the wires and install the twist connector..\n\nALL SOLID COPPER JUMPERS TRAVEL FROM THE DBL GANG BOX INTO THE ETC BOX..\nUSE YELLOW TWIST CONNECTORS: for 2 wires..\nUSE ~ RED ~ TWIST CONNECTORS: for 3 wires..\n\nEVERY TIME YOU CONNECT A WIRE,\ninto a connector or terminal, \"monitor\" when the wires snug up by pulling lightly on the wire (or \"ALL\" the wires if a twist connector)..  When you find the wire (wires) are starting too hold together, then twist a few more times, then verify that the wires cannot be pulled out by hand..  This may sound tedious, but its easy, and if you dont, there will probably be a bad connection that will haunt you and make the equipment act flakey down the road..  I hate to suggest this, because tightening these twist connectors with your fingers is should be adequate..  But I cheat and \"gently\" hold all the wires with the pliers to get the last turn..  IF YOU DO THIS, MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT DAMAGE THE WIRE CASINGS (I guess you could add electrical tape if you need to)..\n\nHOW TO STRIP THE ENDS OF THE EXTENSION CORD WIRES:\nThe solid wires are easy to strip (so here is how to do the stranded ones)..  Strip to 3/4 inch (or a pinch longer because stranded wires pull up slightly when you tighten them)..  The elec pliers most people have are for solid copper, not stranded, so use one gauge larger to strip the ends (or you \"will\" shave off the copper strands of the wires)..  The plastic is usually soft on these, so you can swirl the wire in a circular shape (in the larger gauge hole of the pliers) to strip the ends..  If you only have a knife be extra careful stripping the ends because the thin strands are very easy to cut when you score..  Fortunately, the casing on these is usually easier to remove (so lightly score and pull with fingers usually works)..\n\nINSTALL CONNECTOR on :::::: SOLID:\nHold solid copper together with the ends even and twist the connector on..\n\nINSTALL CONNECTOR on :::::: SOLID TO STRANDED:\nThese are a little trickier..  Twist each individual stranded wire tip to make it act more like a solid wire..  When you hold the ends together to attach the twist connector, the ends of the stranded should be slightly longer than the copper, slightly overlapping (longer than the solid) but we are only talking 1/16 inch (or less)..  Solid to stranded is trickier, so if it fails (you find you can pull it out with your fingers), try again (until you can not pull the wires out by hand)..  There is extra length in the wires, so it it fails twice, then cut off the frayed ends (1 inch), and try again..\n\nBEGIN ACTUAL WIRING CONNECTIONS:\nBEGIN ACTUAL WIRING CONNECTIONS:\nBEGIN ACTUAL WIRING CONNECTIONS:\n\n-1-  CONNECT GROUND WIRE IN DBL GANG BOX:\nLocate the green screw that came with the box (you can find the screw hole location in the pictures for this item)..  This screw will cut its own threads when you screw it into the hole (which makes a sure electrical connection)..  Wrap the copper wire around the screw in a semi circle around the screw (bend circle in the direction so that tightening the screw will tend to close the circle rather than open it)..  Tighten down the screw..  Install twist connector..\n\nGROUND IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE:\nwe have wires in a metal box, and so it must be grounded for electrical safety..  Likewise, this ground wire will transfer thru the extension cord to also ground the metal cabinet of the FRIG (to prevent the metal FRIG casing from becoming 120 VOLTS if an electrical fault develops someday)..\n\n-2-  CONNECT WHITE WIRES..  White jumper to UPPER RIGHT TERMINAL BLOCK (C terminal on the right)..\n\n-3-  CONNECT THE BLACK WIRE FROM THE SIDE THAT PLUGS INTO THE WALL:  This one has 2-BLACK jumper wires into the ETC box (to provide 120 V power to two places)..\nBlack jumper to UPPER RIGHT TERMINAL BLOCK (120, middle terminal).\nBlack jumper to LOWER LEFT TERMINAL BLOCK (C terminal on the right)..\n\n-4-  CONNECT THGE BLACK WIRE THAT WILL GO TO THE FRIG (RED JUMPER)..  Red jumper goes to LOWER LEFT TERMINAL BLOCK Normally Open (NO) terminal in the middle..\n\nADD RUBBER FEET TO THE BOX:\nSee the SHOPPING LIST SECTION for details..  Locate the screws and washers you bought and attach the feet thru the same holes that hold the BOX cover in place..  I did not do this part, so you may have to improvise.. There are several options..\n\nIf the screws I asked for in the SHOP LIST don't work well (and the feet still are not very secure)..  You can simply go back and buy the exact same size screw that came with the feet (sheet metal screw), but at least 1/2 inch longer..  This will probably work without washers, because with a longer screw you will not need to over tighten (which then pops the rubber feet off the screws) to secure the cover, and the head will be larger too..  But try to use washers anyway here..\n\nVERIFY ALL WIRING WAS DONE CORRECTLY:\nVERIFY ALL WIRING WAS DONE CORRECTLY:\nVERIFY ALL WIRING WAS DONE CORRECTLY:\n\nIt's stupid to leave anything to chance when it comes to electricity..  There are usually layers of safety built into the system, but believe me one or more layers are frequently already compromised due to shoddy workmanship and defective materials (and you never know what might happen if you spill some frig liquid, or a kid pulls on the wires..  Make sure the wiring was done correctly here so this safety layer remains intact..\n\nOPTIONS:\nThere are several ways to test this..

I actually didn't buy a replacement for the leaking but because the plastic bracket holding the separate cleaning solution container broke and the container would no longer stay in place and the machine could not be used without it in place.  Like others, I agree that this container is better designed with the cleaning solution container molded into the main water container with a sturdier design than the way the bracket for the cleaning solution was designed for the old one.  I am not sure if something has changed with the way they sell this or it is dependent on the seller (as I got mine from a third party seller FBA) but my replacement steamvac container has the handle, seals, and lids included.  I was reading the reviews and was concerned that there would be no handle so I held onto my old container but to my relief the old handle was not needed.\n\nThis fit perfectly onto my machine but I initially thought I had a problem with my steamvac as when I first used this with the new container in place, I noticed I wasn't getting as much water up from the carpet as I was with my old container.  I then realized that my old container was leaking so badly that I was using the water so much faster as it was spilling onto the carpet and therefore being sucked up by the machine.  So the seals in both the caps and the bottom area that connects into the machine are much better than the old design.\n\nThe tank itself is a solid thicker plastic than my old one and appears to be better made overall.  Like others have indicated the openings for the solution and water is flat with a locking cap as opposed to having a lipped top with the lid screwing onto that.  Maybe that creates a better seal with the caps but it does make it a bit harder to deal with when filling up and emptying.\n\nMy one issue with this is the cost which I think is a bit pricey but this is cheaper here than from the manufacturer which is around 20 dollars more.\n\nIt works and it an improvement over the old container.\n\n4 stars","summary":"Better than the original container and mine came with the handle","unixReviewTime":1456531200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_215"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Hi2+VrI-L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"3","verified":true,"reviewTime":"11 19, 2014","reviewerID":"A2WIIPLMWSJY8T","asin":"B0017VHI38","style":{"Size:":" 1 count","Color:":" Frosted Ice"},"reviewerName":"MadamMorgan","reviewText":"Exactly what I needed for my nursing bag.

The pics don't do it justice.\n\nThe iGaging EZ Cal digital caliper easily stands out in quality and accuracy when compared to the other 2 main contenders in the under $30 price category (the Neiko and Carrera). Comparing them side by side it is no contest in terms of build quality and finish. You can tell they took extra steps in the polishing and finishing process which makes them look more sleek and professional. It is also obvious they they build these to much tighter tolerances than the Neiko and Carrera. There isn't any \"slop\" or \"wiggle room\" between the measuring body and the ruling body which is why it scored the highest of all of the calipers for accuracy and repeat-ability. The display is HUGE and covers most of the measuring body. Very smooth over-all.\n\nWhile it's bigger brother,the iGaging OriginCal, took first place due to it's absolute origin feature, I would not have any hesitation trusting the EZCal for critical measurements down to .0005\" which is not something I would say for the Neiko or Carrera.\n\nPros:\n~ Good Accuracy over-all.\n~ Solid build design!\n~ Well polished/finished which makes it look better than the others\n~ Takes a Commonly available CR2032 (comes with an extra battery)\\\n~ Battery Compartment is Not Going to Break On You\n~ IP54 rating for moisture and dust resistance\n~ Large, Clear, Easy to Read Display. Largest Display of all of the calipers\n~ Auto-Off After Inactivity Feature\n~ Fractional measurement to the 128th\n~ Over-All, the best $25 you can spend on an entry level caliper\n\nCons:\n~ No Auto-On when you start moving the body. (this might help with battery life?)\n\nWatch the full video series to make an informed buying decision.\n\nWHICH CALIPERS DID I REVIEW IN THIS VIDEO?\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mitutoyo-ABSOLUTE-500-196-20-Digital-Caliper-Stainless-Steel-Battery-Powered-Inch-Metric-0-6-Range-0-001-Accuracy-0-0005-Resolution/dp/B001C0ZPNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mitutoyo ABSOLUTE 500-196-20 Digital Caliper, Stainless Steel, Battery Powered, Inch/Metric, 0-6\" Range, +/-0.001\" Accuracy, 0.0005\" Resolution</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/iGaging-IP54-Electronic-Digital-Caliper-0-6-Display-Inch-Metric-Fractions-Stainless-Steel-Body/dp/B001AQEZ2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">iGaging IP54 Electronic Digital Caliper 0-6\" Display Inch/Metric/Fractions Stainless Steel Body</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Carrera-Precision-CP9806-TF-Titanium-0-Inch-to-6-Inch-Electronic-Fractional-Decimal-Digital-Caliper/dp/B003119EDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Carrera Precision CP9806-TF Titanium 0-Inch to 6-Inch Electronic Fractional & Decimal Digital Caliper</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Carbon-Fiber-Digital-Caliper-Central-Storm/dp/B00CUMWJKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Carbon Fiber Digital Caliper Central Storm</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Neiko-01407A-Stanless-Steel-6-Inch-Digital-Caliper-with-Extra-Large-LCD-Screen-and-Instant-SAE-Metric-Conversion/dp/B000GSLKIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Neiko 01407A Stanless Steel 6-Inch Digital Caliper with Extra-Large LCD Screen and Instant SAE-Metric Conversion</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Capri-Tools-6-Inch-Digital-Caliper-with-Fractional-Display-MM-SAE-Extra-Large-LED-Screen/dp/B007SWYRUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Capri Tools 6-Inch Digital Caliper with Fractional Display/MM/SAE & Extra Large LED Screen</a>\n\n[...]","summary":"Won The 7 Digital Caliper Roundup for the Under $30 Price Point","unixReviewTime":1391385600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_226"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B7gurHQJL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711ku7bmFtL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7110dIAf8eL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Im2oRIHwL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"10 22, 2016","reviewerID":"AV1HJ7NSWTYQM","asin":"B001BLMC1M","reviewerName":"Joshua Libertine","reviewText":"I was mid mix when I decided\n\"I love these so much I'll just go and review them\"\nGreat great great buy, they are pretty thick as well\nit says narrow mouth but they are pretty wide.\nThe top lip of one of my flasks is flat not sure exactly why but other than that these are perfect for what I'm using them for","summary":"Get your breaking bad on with these bad boys!!!","unixReviewTime":1477094400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_227"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iCzaRfypL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+o4mqFPZL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"14","verified":true,"reviewTime":"02 7, 2017","reviewerID":"A35GMMSUPSAY5H","asin":"B001DC9USC","style":{"Style:":" Screw Kit"},"reviewerName":"Spencer S.","reviewText":"I love having multiple sizes on hand!

Calibration works best if you use wash sample 4.01 than to sample 4.01 with temp prop and repeat. this meter is not junk it does take a little time to read to higher level the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is faster but not has accurate but close.  the Milwaukee MW102 PH unit is a basic PH meter with temp sample field unit good price in market for what it is--(no data sd card slots etc...). thanks milwaukee. (if the unit goes bad or anything i will post it so far so good).\n\nunit is runing ok so far had to re calibrate (did it several) times with wash 4.01 and the test 4.01 etc.. and the meter sames to be reading +/- about 2 or 3 more close to 2. the meter works well just wish it would find its calibration zone faster. there are times where is just struggles to find the calibration and the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is all ready there. I have ordered cleaning solution to see if this helps.\n\nok i am returning this unit the 102 and will try the Milwaukee 105 pro model. the 102 just too many time takes to long to find it self to many times, eats up way to much time and i have to 2nd check it (so if i check 50 pools a day this meter will kill me... maybe probe change or broad but i can not use it working like this.\n\ni will update on the Milwaukee 105 pro after using it i will update findings.\n\nOK Milwaukee 105 pro works great. We had to call the company and get a replacement probe for unknown reason the 1st probe was faulty. the tech guys at Milwaukee are very helpful and help us with new replacement probe.  the Milwaukee 105 reads a little faster it sames than the 102 but the run is at time very close. BUT it works very well and both PH and TEMP are displayed on screen with this unit makes it nice to not have to switch screens. (the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is faster). this test is great for bench and table work. (after calibration this 105 meter was 100% on the money 4.00 and 7.00 and reads with a very high degree accuracy.\n\nFinal NOTE: Both units 102 and 105 Milwaukee's are (2 points) calibration the  Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 is a (3 point) we called many companies for the answer and we are told that 3 points calibrate faster and many companies are moving to the pens and 3 point and auto cal from factory like the  Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 this pen has factory calibration without any butter set by the factory watch you can at any time set it back to factory ((we checked factory and it is right on for 4.0 ((not 0.00)) that good. like to see other meters have this option.\n\nconclusion: 102 and 105 Milwaukee's are (2 points)slower than (3 points) work great. Great product and the Milwaukee's customer service was very helpful and fixed any issues. the Oakton EcoTestr pH 2 we use and it is a great meter with great factory reset calibration without solution.\n\nhope this helps all and please leave commands for others if you want thank you.","summary":"good piece of equipment works well reads slow at times but so far accurately to a pretty good degree","unixReviewTime":1392076800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_229"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Gd1HeYCPL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"13","verified":true,"reviewTime":"08 29, 2016","reviewerID":"A1KMBH59N9SQC","asin":"B001E5ZWT4","reviewerName":"A.Sperelli","reviewText":"I am a big fan of duct tape. I usually buy the quintessential silver tape from 3M or Scotch, but after reading a really cool article on the Popular Mechanics website where they did a stress test comparing 4 brands of tape (Gorilla being one of them) to see which could take more abuse I was really impressed with how the Gorilla tape outshone the other brands. So, I decided I need to get some and see it in action for myself. I bought the to-go size because I figured that being smaller, I could more easily keep it stashed in the glove box of my car for emergencies.\n\nI can not stress enough how amazing this tape is. After using it myself, its the only tape I will ever want to use for anything serious. It is really sturdy; it kind of gives you the impression that it will be impossible to tear off a piece because its super strong, but you can easily rip off a piece with no problem. Its also much stickier than regular duct tape. I don't know how they do it, but once you attach this tape to something, it will stay there until you want it off.\n\nI used this Gorilla tape successfully in 2 kind of weird situations after regular duct tape failed me:\n\n1) I wanted to hang some thick fabric to temporarily conceal the back windows of my station wagon so as not to tempt any thieves when I had to store some valuables in the back. I had initially tried using regular duct tape, but the weight of the fabric with the less-than-ideal surface (vertical vinyl wall) meant that it failed after a few hours. With only a few small pieces of gorilla tape that fabric was attached and didn't come off until I removed it several days later.\n\n2) The tub in my apartment was resurfaced before I moved in, but the company didn't do a great job so the top layer got compromised by some kind of minor punctures. This allowed water to go between the top later and the porcelain underneath. Since my apartment complex wouldnt be able to resurface it for a few weeks, in the meantime I forced the water out and sealed the holes with regular duct tape. After about 2 days, the duct tape detached and water seeped between the layers again. Then I remembered my trusty Gorilla tape! I forced out the water again and this time sealed the holes with Gorilla tape. Now, this doesnt look beautiful; Im not about to win an award from HGTV. But as a temporary stop-gap, the Gorilla tape is working! After multiple showers, it is not showing any signs of peeling off.\n\nThis tape is pricier than standard duct tape, but in this case you definitely get what you pay for and a little bit goes a long way. For run of the mill jobs, standard duct tape is probably adequate. However, the minute regular duct tape won't cut it, seriously consider giving Gorilla a try. Theres really nothing better. If you found this review helpful, please consider clicking yes below.\n\nI have noticed that several reviews I have written on items purchased through Amazon have had the \"Verified Purchase\" removed incorrectly and as a result are no longer visible, which is likely happening to other people as well.

Worked great. Resealed a front window on a 26 year old class C motor home that was dripping water into the interior. Several key points. I was working with a flat smooth surface. I put the seal tape in the refrigerator due to the hot muggy evening weather. Clean all surfaces very well. Mineral spirits, scraper and window cleaner did the job. Get all the old seal material off the surfaces. Beware it does stretch easily so position it correctly the first time. Also note it will stretch as you remove the paper backing. Apply it to surfaces first then remove the backing. I found the window frame screws were also rusting so I replaced them with #10 1 inch stainless steel screws. Drove them in lightly with a screw gun and then  hand tightened the screws down until the new seal tape extruded and the screws were snug. It is raining now and no more leaking. I will trim up the excess seal tape once the rain stops. The job from start to finish took about 2 1/2 hours. Cleaning all the surfaces in which the seal tape needs to come into contact with is a bit tedious and time. consuming but well worth the effort to know there is no water leaking under the window frame. I was quoted $200 to reseal the window. I spent less than $30 using a single roll of seal tape and stainless steel screws.

So, I tried these. Perfect fit for Gyro 80mm 85A wheels and for the stock Seba Space Invader wheels. These are greased, not oiled, so they don't have that 15 second spin when turned in hand; more like 5 seconds  But, when they are hot from rolling, they spin better. They need to be broken in.  Then, they spin just fine.  Are they similar to a $40 set of ABEC-9 bearings when broken in?  No, they're still slower because, again, they're greased. That said, if one must have faster, they could degrease the bearings with any standard cleaning solution, dry them, and add a light oil and then they'd be much like an AbEC-7 bearing, at least. Great vs oil has its advantages, too, such as less need to reapply.  For me, I'm thrilled to get so many races of bearings for less than half of the name brand's cost. And, if they get gritty or rusted, I might clean them one time, but after that just toss them.  With the name brand expensive jobbers, I'm more likely to keep cleaning and using beyond their expected life just to avoid another money outlay.  I'm happy with these.

And they've worked very well for that purpose. I used ink stamps (also purchased on Amazon- this shop truly is the everything store). They came in a variety of designs from 'Happy Birthday' to 'Congratulations'. Most paper gift tags were too small to use them with. And I like bigger gift tags so that I can write a personal message on the back.\n\nThese particular tags, because they are made for shipping, are extremely durable. The hole at the top has a reinforcement ring around it so it can't easily be ripped off. The card itself is thick card stock. A little thicker than average computer paper- but not quite as thick as a Hallmark card. You can bend them and cut them easily if you need too. But they won't rip or tear- even during rigorous travel (a good trait if you actually are using them as shipping tags).\n\nEach tag comes with white string. The string is merely wrapped around the tag, not permanently connected. So it can be removed or replaced if need be. But I chose to simply use the string. Once again it's very strong and well-made. Not sure what kind of string it is. I guess I'd call it more of a twine with a waxy coating on it.\n\nThe tags were very easy to write on. They have a smooth surface that works well with ink and pencil. The ink from my stamps didn't run or smudge. It dried very evenly. The tan color of the paper gives the gift tags a very vintage look- which is exactly what I was hoping for (as I bought vintage designed greetings stamps). They look really neat! For the price of the stamps and the tags, I was able to make 100 gift tags (for different occasions) for about $20.00. Way cheaper than I could find them in any store. And it was a fun activity for a day as well. Overall I'm really happy with this purchase. And when I need more extra large gift tags I know where I'll be coming back to get them from.

Turns out most of the cheap ones won't drill through stainless. The basic principle is obvious: to drill through any material, the bit needs to be made of a harder material. Its why diamonds are used commonly for cutting applications. Its the hardest material available.\n\nFor step bits, (and other metal drilling bits) the best material is cobalt. However, the cheap ones won't last, because they either don't have cobalt in them, or they just coat them in a thin layer of cobalt. So be wary of tricky advertising.\n\nI found this TEMO that had great reviews and after reading about it, turns out its made completely out of cobalt. AND it was not as expensive as other brands. I was skeptical because i had read that to get a cobalt one, you would have to spend 50 bucks or more.\n\nThis baby cost about 20 bucks and I have to say, it went through my 18 gauge stainless steel kitchen sink like butter. Here's how we went about it:\nOther materials/tools needed:\nCenter Punch : Starrett 117C Center Punch\nCutting Oil: CRC 03400 16oz Truetap Cutting Fluid\n\n0- Of course, measure twice, drill once to ensure the hole is in the place you want.\n1- Use a center punch and hammer. Pound it until a small divot is seen on the sink. Dont be afraid to pound with force. Just be careful with your hands :) The divot is necessary to steady the bit in place.\n2- Mark the step that you want to reach with a permanent marker. It will be easier to see where you are at. Pour 2 - 3 drops of cutting oil (I used CRC 03400 Truetap Cutting Fluid Heavy) on the divot. Also pour 1 - 2 drops on the tip of the step-bit. Let the bit be covered by the extra oil. You can smear it with your finger.\n3- Drill on the lowest setting. NO HAMMER ACTION. Start slow.\n4- You will see that the bit starts chewing on the metal. If the bit starts to smoke, STOP. If you see too much metal debris, STOP. Clean the bit, clean the area. Dip the bit in water to cool it (won't damage the bit at all). Dry the bit and re-apply oil to it. Repply oil to the clean area. Cleaning the area is necessary to avoid unnecessary friction and heat. Makes the job end up nicer.\n5- Continue. You may increase speed once the bit is steady. Keep an eye for the smoke and cool the bit if necessary.\n6- Once the tip of the bit is completely thru the metal, it becomes very easy. Don't apply too much force. Its better to go slow than to drill a hole thats too big. You can't get back from that.\n7- Enjoy!\n\nThe bit made a very clean hole, no sanding necessary. The bit also showed no signs of wear and tear.\nThe time it took to drill the hole was about 5 minutes.","summary":"Drills through 18 gauge stainless like butter","unixReviewTime":1502064000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_274"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/413Z1VQZ9NL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"7","verified":true,"reviewTime":"02 14, 2015","reviewerID":"A3P09GI06CGD3B","asin":"B0038O8LY2","reviewerName":"Ed Dwan","reviewText":"I use this as the base for my yeast starters as it is very light, and doesn't affect the flavor of my brew when I pitch the yeast.

The foam in the lid was too tight for the box lit to close w/o distorting it so i used a 5/8 fortner bit turned backwards by hand on the foam to cut a nice circle, using the same trick i cut a circle in a piece of smooth cardboard and pressed down on the foam so the cut circle would 'pop up' through the cardboard and used an extendable razor knife to slice off about 80% of the thickness of the foam; now i  have a complete set including 100g individual weight and enough other weights i can easily calibrate my two 200g scales.\n\nI managed to 'tiddly wink' one of the 20mg weights across the room and lost it and am pretty sure the kit came with a 5mg weight that went missing on first use; so word to the wise be very careful opening the ziplock bag with the micro weights!\n\nMy new scales have 0.01g precision and all the weights appear to be well within 0.01g tolerance as i've been getting exactly repeatable measurements.\n\nthe mg weights could be made better and with consistency (e.g. all stainless steel so they won't disappear in the presence of a magnet) and it would be *really nice* considering the size of them and the negligible cost, that there might be some spares! That said it would be a solid 5 stars if it had the mystery 100g spot filled with a 100g weight and if the tweezer included wasn't pointlessly useless (wouldn't open enough to pick up the 5g weight and broke when trying to stretch it open big enough to do so, also wouldn't grab the mg weights so really literally useless). Super happy on the purchase and would most definitely buy again. (and modify again and through out the useless tweezer again)","summary":"almost perfect, very easy to modify and make complete","unixReviewTime":1399161600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_284"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lQjgibwJL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":1,"vote":"41","verified":true,"reviewTime":"01 7, 2016","reviewerID":"A1B3V68TA4SQY","asin":"B003ULZGFU","style":{"Size:":" 3 Ton,All-in-One"},"reviewerName":"V.

Hill","reviewText":"Attached are a nine photographs under customer images on the product page (left hand side of page - click view and share images) which reflect what I saw in various applications using the tool and snapping pictures with the built-in camera. These photographs were stored on the mini-SD card which is not included with the camera but readily available at minimal expense. I think I paid $18 for an 4 GB mini card at a big box store. Comparing what I saw on the video screen with the photographs I captured, reflected some degradation in quality. In use, the screen shows a clearer image for the user.\n\nThe instruction manual is surprisingly small, just sixteen pages. Eight of those pages are dedicated to safety and battery information. Accomplishing most tasks is very straightforward. For example, taking a picture or video entails sliding in the charged battery and SD mini card (it will handle up to 16 GB mini card,) installing the cable and turning on the two sections of the camera (LED screen and the camera cable) then, when ready, selecting the picture taking or video button. The included 12 volt lithium ion battery charged in 15 minutes.\n\nSo while getting the inspection camera set up is quick, using the inspection camera is not intuitive - it must be played with it for a while to get a feel for how moving the camera affects what is seen on the video screen. It reminded me of using binoculars and searching for a reference point - okay, that's the pine tree on the left now I know where I am. Clearly in certain situations it will be more or less difficult to locate a reference point.\n\nTo try out the camera I first looked inside my just cleaned five year old garbage disposal. I am almost embarrassed to post the pictures. Yes, we don't eat out of it but still it looks disgusting and shows a lot of rust. Replacing the unit has now moved up on the to-do list.\n\nNext I looked into one of the floor heating/air conditioning vents. In our first home (a brand new townhome) I found debris in some pretty strange places like bones from fried chicken in the floor vents and uncovered that fast food remnants were the source of mysterious lumps in the carpet. So, I wondered what I'd find when I looked down the heating/air conditioning vents in our current residence, a five year old home.\n\nThe debris in the picture is what I encountered about eighteen inches past the opening - just out of view. Lots of sawdust, pieces of aluminum sheet metal, construction material wrappers, insulation trimmings, carpet and padding debris along with a puzzle piece from the previous owner. Then I pushed the three foot cable the full length into the vent, and although I found a penny along with a small amount of debris, it is basically clean.\n\nA look behind the washer and dryer usually requires pulling them away from the wall and sometimes necessitates disconnecting hoses. I saw no leaks and little lint accumulation - it looks pretty good back there.\n\nNext I tucked the camera into my car's wheel well. I honestly don't know enough about cars to know what I am looking at but the photos are a good example of what the user sees. These car photos were taken while I was standing in the garage with the door closed and positioned the camera curved upward at the end.\n\nThe three foot cable is stiff but flexible. I shoved it down a floor vent and it was willing to adapt to the terrain encountered. I also bent the cable at a severe 45 and then 90 degree angle and it will stay fixed in that position.  The cable is waterproof up to the point where it connects to the base of the unit. Obviously this is a necessary feature depending upon the selected application.\n\nThere is an adjustment wheel on the trigger area of the camera that controls the brightness of the light which I found a real plus. For example the garbage disposal required less light than the floor vent.  The close-up option increases the image in increments of 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 times actual.\n\nIn a perfect world the tool would provide an option to increase or decrease the picture quality. In its current state it is fixed. I also found the lack of ability to focus the lens, frustrating. One must pull back or push forward the cable to focus which was less precise and more time consuming than simply having that ability built-in to the camera.\n\nWith a couple of minor complaints I still found this to be one heck of a handy tool and I'm sure I will continue to find endless uses. For example, I am curious but have resisted the urge to run the cable into a hole I discovered while raking leaves in the front yard. What kind of little animal lives in the hole?  Of course it could be a snake, so best let it rest.\n\nI have big plans to drill holes in the wall above my kitchen cabinets and run wire for security cameras and speakers up from the basement. This inspection tool and wire snaring hook and magnet will be invaluable to accomplish the task with minimal aggravation.\n\nIf not in a profession where this is an essential tool, this would make a perfect gift for someone who loves tools. It has endless uses and odds are the potential recipient doesn't already own it.","summary":"Great for an  Inspector, And the Best Non-Essential Tool for the Rest of Us, Ever","unixReviewTime":1291852800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_291"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ir-hKvriL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-fukobLCL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"91","verified":false,"reviewTime":"12 4, 2010","reviewerID":"A3IUW081KXD3PE","asin":"B0043XX89K","reviewerName":"Reviewer","reviewText":"As is typical, Dewalt housed this camera in a custom case with carrying handle.  The unit can be stored in the case fully assembled, or in varying stages of assembly.  There is a small compartment with a door for the hook and magnet attachments. The charger is stored on its side in the case. It would be nice if it stored flat in the case so you wouldn't have to remove it for charging. Some of the Rigid Tool cases are set up this way and I find it to be efficient.\n\nThe initial setup was fairly basic with easy to follow instructions. There are settings for date & time and display formats for each.  Charging the battery took 30 minutes.  This particular unit needs the grey stripe on the camera end to be on top, relative to the handle. While the image is still not square on the screen, it is better than the inverted image I got the first time I assembled it. There is a key shaped like a hexagon that prevents the cable from spinning on the mount. This key is not aligned accurately for the image to be completely square on the screen.\n\nThe screen is a nice size for viewing. The resolution is high enough for the unit's intended use. I wouldn't try to watch a movie on it, although you could (without sound) from the micro SD card that is sold separately. It has 3 zoom levels: 1.5X, 2X, and 3X. The zoom is purely digital and creates the expected artifacts as the zoom is increased. This camera is not intended as a super high-end imaging system.  The screen can be used remotely from the handle/camera assembly. By remotely, I mean about 10 - 15 feet away. The wireless signal is not strong and is easily distorted by the way you handle/hold the unit. This isn't a practical use problem.  The screen and handle have separate power controls. This makes sense because they can be used remotely from each other. However, you must remember to switch both off to conserve battery power.\n\nThe camera is housed at the end of the cable. The images are transmitted electrically, not optically (as in fiber optics). Therefore, little degradation of image should occur when using the extension cables that are available (sold separately).  The camera cable is flexable but stiff. There is an adjustable light housed at the end of the cable with the camera.  It should also be noted that the camera and cable are water proof up to the point where they attach to the housing of the hand held unit.  Submerged, picture clarity is only as good as the water is clear.  The hook and magnet accessories are made of sturdy spring steel. It can easily lift a wire inside a wall. The magnet is quite strong for its 1/4\" diameter size. The attachments mount securely to the camera end. It lifts a medium size pairs of pliers with no problem. The cable is flexible enough to make a circle 9 inches in diameter.\n\nBecause Amazon's page doesn't provide a lot of the features and specifications of this camera, I have included the following manufacturer's information:\n\nFrom Dewalt:\n\nDeWalt new DCT410S1 12 Volt MAX* Inspection Camera features a wireless 3.5-inch LCD screen that is removable to provide contractors greater visibility in tight areas.

So why pay five times the price for this tester? For one thing, it is much easier to understand than watching lights flash. The LCD readout shows clearly how the pins on the near end map to the pins on the far end. It also does some thinking for you and can tell you if the cable has shorts, opens, or is wired as a crossover cable. But the real reason to get this tester rather than a dumb 10 dollar model is that it can detect split pairs. These occur due to the (somewhat non-intuitive) fact that a CAT cables twisted pairs are NOT wired like this:\n(1-2) (3-4) (5-6) (7-8)\nInstead, the twisted pairs actually terminate like this:\n(1-2) [3-] (4-5) [-6] (7-8)\n\nThis strange wiring is a holdover from telephone jacks where the center two pins carry line 1, and the flanking set of pins carry line 2. A cable with split pairs will check out okay all day long on a simple continuity test, but will not actually carry data very well if the cable is longer than about 10 ft because the crosstalk is so extreme.

While it does cost more than competing off-shore bits it is also significantly superior in all respects.\n\nThe Good:\nSmooth, sharp cutting edges allows one to produce clean accurate holes with ease in thin metal, plastic and wood.\nPointed tip does indeed prevent the bit from wandering or skipping when starting a hole. No counterpunch or pre-drilling required to achieve accuracy.\nThe shank is formed to fit 1/4 hex drivers. The amazon product photo does not show these newer driver style shanks (at the time of this review).\nMarkings are highly visible and easy to read.\nThe quality workmanship of this product is obvious: sharp, finely machined, highly visible markings.\n\nThe Bad:\nThere really isn't anything serious to complain about, so consider the following list to be nit-picking\nThe bit fits standard 1/4 hex drivers, but the shank section before the groove is a bit shorter than normal (see photo). This is no problem whatsoever in magnetic drivers. In my non-magnetic Makita impact driver the bit had slightly more in-and-out play than usual, but it did not affect drilling performance. (I warned you I was nit-picking!).\n\nSummary:\nIf you enjoy using top quality tools then this set is worthy of your consideration.\n\nIf you like short reviews - stop here!\n\nOn the other hand, if you like lots of extra information, then please by all means read-on\n\nThe bit has a hex shank for positive slip-free use in standard drill chucks. This #2 bit also fits in standard 1/4 drill drivers, impact drivers, etc. At the time of this review, the amazon description states they have a 3 flatted shank which is not accurate - mine has a six sided shank, also known as a hex shank.\n\nIrwin Unibit #2:\nIrwin Item #: 10232\nHole Sizes: 3/16 - 1/2\nStep increment: 3/8\nNumber of steps: 6\nStep Height (i.e. max material thickness): 3/8\nOverall Length: 3-1/8\nShank Size Across flats: 1/4\nDrill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/4\n\nI happen to own some low cost import step drill bits (a Neiko 10193A set, in near new condition). It is immediately obvious that the Irwin bits are better quality than the Neikos in appearance and legibility of the step-size markings. Ill post a picture showing an Irwin and Neiko side by side. In use the Irwin bits cut sheet metal faster, producing smoother edges (less burrs) and more well rounded holes. For rough work on a tight budget the Neiko may be a good choice. Otherwise Id recommend the Irwin bits.\n\nWhen is a step drill better than a standard metal drill bit?\n\nWhen drilling sheet metal. You get better formed holes, less burrs, and less grab as the bit exits the material. As hole diameter increases these differences become even more pronounced.\nLess torque required. With wider diameter holes, a standard drill bit is engaging the entire diameter of the material at once. Whereas a step drill engages a fraction of that. This results in easier drilling, and less torque on ones wrists and hands. The workpiece is also less likely to be torn out of your hand when your grip is not firm enough.\nWhen a standard drill bit is too long. Step drills are shorter than standard drill bits. For example a 1/2 (max) step drill is about half the length of comparable metal drill bit.\nIts possible to de-burr holes with a step drill by just allowing the next step size to lightly touch the material before you stop drilling. It takes a bit of practice, but can save time especially when drilling a lot of holes.\nIf you need to enlarge an existing hole, and want it well centered on the original hole. This can work nicely even in wood, when drilling with Forstner (flat bottomed) bits - the Unibit can cut a 1/8 wider starter hole which is just enough to keep the Forstner bit centered.\nSmooth cutting step drills - like this Irwin bit - cuts plastic sheet much better than regular bits, especially as hole sizes increase. I found it easy to produce clean edged, accurate holes with the Irwin step bits in my handheld drill. Trying to use standard bits often made a mess of things, unless the holes where small (say less than 1/4 diameter).\nA single step drill bit might save one the hassle of carrying a set of standard drill bits, but of course only when all the material you are drilling is thin enough.\n\nWhen is a standard metal drill bit better?\n\nWhen you want to make no mistake about drilling too large a hole. A regular drill bit always makes the same hole size - no need to count the steps - which can be very reassuring when drilling into a valuable workpiece.\nIn thicker heavier material, or when you need non-through holes. Step drills just aren't designed to do this.\n\nOther details and observations:\n\nUse step bits to quickly measure the diameter of existing holes. Just insert the bit until its snug and read the diameter from the it. Of course the step drill needs to have high quality markings for this to be practical.\nEnlarge an existing hole, while keeping the center of the hole unchanged.\nYou can (almost) double the effective depth of cut of your step drill if you are able to drill in from both sides of a hole.\nI was able to produce accurate, clean holes in 3/4 thick fir plywood when I drilled it to the maximum diameter of the bit. So if you live with 1/2 holes you are not really constrained as to thickness of your wood. The bit cut quickly and cleanly through the material. Of course this is a very special case, but I thought it worth mentioning nonetheless.\nOne review claimed that these bits cut in two directions. To test this I tried making holes in hardwood by running my drill in reverse. It worked poorly, cutting action much slower and the quality of the hole was not as good as running the bit in a normal (clockwise) direction.\nIn hardwoods, I found step drills to be a quick and effective way to remove the ragged edges and slivers on the back sides of freshly drilled holes. You do need a light touch, and a bit of practice to obtain consistent results.\n\nIf you would like to see more images of bits, test cuts, and so on, please see my review of the Irwin 10225 Unibit set.\n\nI hope you found this information useful. If so your feedback would be much appreciated.","summary":"High Quality Bit, Works well in Plastic, Metal, Wood","unixReviewTime":1422057600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_309"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Z-RrTVjXL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"08 17, 2017","reviewerID":"A2UFNB9REUD4I3","asin":"B004U3U3DC","style":{"Color Name:":" Gunmetal","Size Name:":" Single"},"reviewerName":"Bob Curry","reviewText":"I wanted to make a coat rack that would hold all our jackets to go on the kitchen area in my house.

I am a home owner who loves woodworking, and I use my home garage as a workshop. With woodworking comes a lot of saw dust and wood particles. I got tired of dragging out my Ridgid shop vac and vacuuming the saw dust off of the floors, walls, and every surface. So then I bought the vacuum hose attachment for my vacuum to my compound miter saw. This was great at first, but I would end up forgetting to either turn off the vacuum or forget to turn it on while cutting lumber!\nThis got me searching the Internet for solutions and DGC Products I-socket came up over and over again! So, I ordered it plugged it in, and I will never have to worry about my vacuum again. This is how it works:\n- plug it into 3 prong wall socket or extension cord\n(IMPORTANT: this is for indoor/covered garage/shop use ONLY, it is NOT waterproof or water resistant)\n-plug in your saw into the \"TOOL\" outlet (or whatever tool your using) on the I-socket\n-plug in your shop vac into the \"VAC\" outlet on the I-socket\n-turn the switch on your shop vac to the \"ON\" position and leave it there\n-and that's it!\n\nWhen you start or turn on your saw (or whatever tool you are using), the I-socket automatically turns on your shop vac. When you stop or turn off your saw (or whatever tool you are using), the I-socket will keep the shop vac running for about 8 seconds after the saw has stopped to clear any saw dust left behind, then it turns off the shop vac! The I-socket is very well made, it uses thick ABS plastic and all the seems are tightly fitted together.\n\nAwesome product, I do recommend it to both professional and hobbyist woodworkers! I do not work for DGC Products, nor do I indorse there products, I am only writing a review off of my personal experience. Also, please, please, please remember SAFETY FIRST when working with electrical outlets, saws, routers, sanders, drills, and other equipment!

I bought this on sale at the store, but wanted to review it because I'm really pleased with it. I have an expensive big name stick vacuum that I've been using and the 15 minute battery life was KILLING me. My other vacuums were older and didn't have great suction so I felt like I couldn't do a good job. After using this and seeing how easy it is to convert for the stairs, I'm almost wishing I hadn't bought the stick vacuum. The only benefit to the stick is that it's a *bit* easier for going up and down the stairs with. I still think this does a better job of vacuuming though.\n\nTo address a few things about this vacuum:\n\n1. If you're used to a bag vacuum, bag-less vacuums sometimes seem like they need to be emptied a lot. This one has a pretty large canister. I only use bag-less vacuums and this one seems huge to me. I like that it empties on both sides of the canister so I don't need to put my hand in there to grab all of the stuff out (like my other vacuum where stuff gets stuck up behind the filter).\n\n2. There are labels all. over. it. I love this. There's a lot of neat features to the vacuum and I don't see myself remembering how to detach all of the parts correctly- but the labels tell you exactly what to do. It makes it a lot easier and faster than dealing with your booklet on the machine.\n\n3. Suction is fabulous. Make sure you put it on the right setting- I was vacuuming with the setting for bare floors for a few moments because I didn't read the button. Whoops.\n\n4. The easy to turn head of the vacuum makes it so easy to get around corners. Yay.\n\nVideo of it in action: [...]","summary":"Love, love, love.

I have used these under substantial heating operations, high vacuum, strong chemicals etc. The markings may not be dead on accurate, but remember that they are for estimation only. The trade off for the low price and reasonably high quality is that over time the physical size from one flask to another is significantly different. The height of the flask can vary quite a bit. All in all, these are a pleasure to work with, high quality, great value, and you don't have to be scared that you are going to crack them.

The instructions are basically, 1) put the two included batteries in and 2) press the big \"on\" button. The detector starts automatically reading the radiation surrounding it, and will conduct four cycles of readings as it draws the four sides of a square (one side per cycle read) shown on the left side of the big number/ reading. This takes about 2 to 3 minutes, and the fully drawn square provides the most accurate reading.\n\nI tried this in our living room for radon (and found this does not read radon), but the .10 micro Sieverts per hour reading was shown (pic). According to the included pamphlet section titled, \"How much is dangerous?\" a .10 reading \"...is low, it does not get any lower\" (see pic of that section below showing various hazard levels). I then tried this next to the tritium sights on my gun, and it also gave a negligible .12 reading.  finally, i tried it on our granite countertops, because i had read that many contractors working with granite or stone often used geiger counters to ensure they were not working with or placing dangerous slabs of granite in people's homes. Our countertop gave a .14 reading. I was happy to see that our place had low readings. i think if i was going to purchase a house in the future, i'd take this with me to check radiation levels inside and outside the property (top soils and such) before buying.\n\nBeyond the basic reading, there is a menu with features including 1) changing from the default micro Sieverts per hour (modern units) measurement to the older micro Roentgens per hour (see backlit pic); 2) an audio threshold alarm you can set to ring at readings between .10-.90 micro Sieverts per hour (it's preset to a default ring at .30);  3) you can enable a separate background radiation function, which the Quarta manufacturing website introduces as the \"new 'BACKGROUND' mode, the first such implementation into a non-professional device, [that] allows for simpler and faster inspections of premises (when it is necessary to know the difference between the indoors and outdoors background radiation values);\"  4) audio and/or vibration alarm choices; and 5) service contact information for the Quarta company (see pic of Quarta-Rad, inc contact info).  There is also a backlight feature that turns on automatically for a few seconds whenever you press a button.\n\nThis is an excellent choice for home safety.\n\n--btw, the batteries both face positive upwards. You can see the positioning drawn on the underside of the battery cover you take off, and in the instruction manual. it is not in the normal place most people look, at the bottom of the battery wells.\n\nUpdate: There are watches from the mid-20th century (pre-1960s) that were made with radium dials- my husband collects many antiques. he tried this next to several of his watches, and one read in near the .84 \"Alert\" zone, which the manual says should be avoided. I insisted that we keep it in a far corner of our garage.... we put it in a steel box, and that reduced the reading to .16. yikes.\n\nUpdate: radon gas needs a different device to measure, such as this manufacturer's SIRAD-MR-106n for $397.","summary":"Great Choice for Beta, Gamma, X-Ray radiation (NOT Radon) and for General Safety- Check old Watches!","unixReviewTime":1457568000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_347"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71v4e7YONGL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"4","verified":true,"reviewTime":"05 27, 2015","reviewerID":"A1ODTLDFEV4S5G","asin":"B0060FGA8A","reviewerName":"T.

I just needed to be informed that I was not the only one who did not know, for no one knows. It's all in a black box called \"Nature.\" Physicists can cloak their ignorance by calling it \"a fundamental force of the universe,\" i.e., \"It's just there -- we don't know why\u0010.\"\n\nKids who can't get to first base in a subject because the opening statement is missing are told they don't have brains or \"aptitude.\"\n\nThe instructions for this kit do some serious blathering, I presume about theory, if I could understand them. These instructions make sure to show you the formula for electromagnetic force (see graphic), they tell you that a drawing showing electromagnetism coming is really about electromagnetism going, and that a drawing of electromagnetism going is really electromagnetism coming, and that clockwise is counterclockwise, and counterclockwise is clockwise (see graphic). They show some doodles and say that one of the doodles is a magnet, but it is not labeled, and if it is there, it looks like any other doodle. Magnets can come in any shape or size. No doubt the drawing of this magnet is what an expert would recognize, but I thought this kit was for rank beginners. Draw a horseshoe, if you're not gong to label it. Then take a course in technical drawing or common sense.\n\nSo I skipped over to what looked like getting to the point. There were some ambiguous and sketchy instructions for constructing the contraption. Being a dummy, I had to look up several words.\n\nSo I ignored the beginning prose, looked up the words, then seemed to have the contraption built that the drawings in the constructions showed, which were not clear.\n\nThen, for a final insult, the entire endeavor crashed and burned into my absolute failure with the following death sentence, the last instruction:\n\n\"6. Apply power by attaching 3 to 6 volt DC to the binding post.\"\n\nNo one said anything about any power. Where is it? Fews ads boast so much about including \"all parts for assembly\" as the ad for this product. All shoppers know the warning \"Batteries not included.\" Wouldn't this ad have said that power is not included if it were not? Therefore, I'm still looking among the parts for this legendary power source. Furthermore, if you parse the term \"electric motor,\" it could be understood to read that it creates power to drive an electric motor. How would beginners know that is called \"a generator?\" Where does it say that this whole contraption is not, in fact, the \"3 to 6 volt DC\" itself?\n\nWhat's a binding post? The instructions won't tell you. I looked it up, and there was nothing like that on my \"finished\" motor.\n\nThe outfit that put me through this wringer -- and no doubt I am the only one who \"just does not get it\" -- is called American Educational Products.\n\nIn the immortal words of Jack Black (School of Rock), \"Those who can't do, teach. Those who can't teach, teach P.E.\" So perhaps the point of this kit is the exercise I got putting it together.","summary":"It's Not \"Electric Motors for Dummies\"","unixReviewTime":1423612800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_353"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fYebcf9hL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kkyxf+6jL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":2,"vote":"9","verified":false,"reviewTime":"07 8, 2016","reviewerID":"A364ORODKP4XFJ","asin":"B006EGAIJ2","style":{"Package Type:":" Frustration-Free Packaging"},"reviewerName":"Tretiak","reviewText":"I bought these from Pep Boys because they had a 25% off sale and the \"16,000 pound\" models were $44 with tax.

The photos supplied by some Amazon customers of the Rhino ramps basically collapsing under load have me strongly considering returning them before I ever use them.\n\nThe stated \"16,000 pound\" load rating is very deceptive. On the bottom of each ramp, the following weight ratings are stamped:\n\"Do Not Exceed Rated Capacity of 4,000 pounds each, 8,000 pounds per pair or 16,000 pounds gross vehicle weight\"\nThey are NOT rated for 16,000 pounds each or as a pair.

I liked the fact that this device is easy to read and only needs a drop or two of wort to get a reading, unlike a hydrometer that requires several ounces of wort to get a reading.  A hydrometer will lead to you wasting several ounces of beer on each reading, which can add up in a small batch.\n\nWhat no one told me, and I wish they had, is that this device starts to be come very inaccurate once there is alcohol in the solution.  So while it's great for measuring the original gravity of your wort, it is not useful once the fermentation process begins.  In order to use it beyond the initial boil, you need to gather readings with both a hydrometer AND the refractometer. Then you can calculate an adjustment factor that will allow you to use the refractometer from that point on.  I'm told that the exact adjustment factor varies with the specific refractometer, so you need to calculate your own.  If I gave you mine here, yours could be very different.\n\nSo if you buy this device and you don't have a hydrometer and test jar, do yourself a favor and order those too.  Then do an Internet search for relevant brewing articles to see how to calculate and use an adjustment specific to your device.\n\nThat may sound like a lot of extra hassle.  If you don't mind tossing out those hydrometer samples (or you are OK drinking the flat beer) then you don't need this device.  If, like me, you like the convenience of an easy-to-read device and the benefit of being able to get gravity readings with very small samples, get yourself a hydrometer, test jar, and this device.  Work out your adjustment factor, and you can put away the hydrometer from that point on... and only need very small samples.\n\nWhen you look at the photos I've posted, bear in mind that the photo of the gauge was taken by holding a cell phone camera up to the opening and trying to get the device, camera, and light source all in alignment (which is a LOT harder than it sounds).  But the beer in question reads roughly 1.075 on the SG scale and 19 on Brix.  All I needed to get that reading was a tiny drop of wort from the tap on my fermenting bucket.\n\nI'm also showing photos of extracting the tiny wort sample, using a pipette (included with the device) to get a couple of drops, the drops of liquid on the prism, and the case it came in.","summary":"A nice device for measuring wort gravity, but be aware of some things","unixReviewTime":1419033600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_358"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XYH18djLL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2018","reviewerID":"AN0ZO1SWXCDLU","asin":"B006GOL5CQ","style":{"Color:":" Purple"},"reviewerName":"Jordan","reviewText":"If you like to keep your knives in good working order and clean them often, a drop of purple low strength loctite will do the job.

The mechanical relays didn't last long last year. So far this year the solid state relays are giving me no troubles. One thing to note however, mechanical relays can typically handle 10 Amps each. These solid state relays can only handle up to 2 Amps each ... enough power for approximately 100 LED lights on each relay, or 800 total lights per relay module. More than enough to dazzle (or cheese-off) the neighbors! No complaints about this board.\n\nUpdate: Well, it's a few days past Xmas and not a single problem from any of the SSRs. I love that I can program the outlets to turn on and off at less than 25ms (the limit I found for mechanical relays). This allows twinkling effects that I couldn't do with mechanical relays. I'm purchasing another one for a 16 channel setup and adding a San Devices e682 to the mix for RGB LED control as well (my neighbors will REALLY love me next year). I use an Arduino Uno to control the relays however any microntroller with at least 8 digital outputs will work well with this relay board.\n\nUpdate #2: I've redesigned my board to use two of these SSR boards for 16 outputs with an Arduino Uno.

First I took a measurement of the thickness with both my digital calipers and this little gem, then divided that result by 2, then took that result and dialed my table saw blade height  to it - VOILA, instant and perfect half lap joint:-)\n\nFor my zero clearance plate - I had some left over composite 2x6 material. Once again, took the thickness measurement of my OEM table saw plate, then took the measurement of the material I was creating the duplicate/zero clearance plate from, subtracted one from the other and that total became the setting of my dado stack height. Once dialed in, I shaved down the composite material and once again a perfect measurement which netted me an exact height match!!:-)\n\nOne thing I do wish, that the legs could open wider/have adjustability to accommodate more use, but, just the way it is, I find it to be very useful:-) The magnets also could stand to be a bit stronger, but not a deal breaker - I've actually got some strong rare earth magnets in my misc drawer that I believe are about the same size.

All of that sits on top of an Cooler Master 212X dual fan computer CPU cooler. Most of the aforementioned pieces are coupled with thermal paste. Power will come from an ATX computer powersupply I made into a bench top power unit. All of this is going on my 'Science & Optics' blogger...for no real reason other than I have more fun doing this than shoveling snow or mowing the lawn.\n\nThe wine goblet is filled with 99% isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol which gets supercooled and turns into a fog in the the glass goblet. Then you can see alpha, beta, gamma and muon tracks zipping through the fog: visible radiation! I have various radioactive sample sources, plus if you put no radioactive stuff in the chamber every 3 or 3 minutes you'll see a particle zing through and that'll be the result of a cosmic ray interaction: a muon!\n\nMy other nuclear cloud chamber is MUCH simpler: an upside down aquarium resting on a metal plate that sits on top of a block of dry ice. I want to eventually bring this into work (I'm a librarian) and while the radioactive stuff is safe (unless you swallow it) the dry ice is just annoying to deal with after the awesomeness of it gets old: it's cold, melts (well, sublimates), will explode any container it gets sealed it, burns, little kids want to touch it...all not so great for a science demonstration. Plus the only place that sells it is the Walmart that's like 15 minute drive. With this design I just plug it into a wall outlet and dump in a little rubbing alcohol: bam! Coldness.\n\nAnyway, this rubber was REAL rubber. Good feel and that new car tire smell. I was able to easily cut it with a pair of scissors.\n\nThe sheet was really \"floppy\" and could conform to curves if needed. You could easily roll this up and line the inside of a coffee mug or something. Not sure why you'd want to do that, but it'd take zero effort: nice and bendy.\n\nThe only bad thing was that at the center of one edge was a retail hanger tag, the kind with the hole in it to hang off of metal rods in a store. It was STAPLED to the rubber sheet. Just a regular old small staple, and for my purposes it made no difference. Even if I were pulling a strong vacuum (which I'm not) the two staple holes would probably seal themselves up, plus they're at the extreme edge so it wouldn't matter anyway.\n\nWell, that's about all the comments I can muster on a boring old piece of rubber, lol.\n\nMichael Logusz","summary":"Nuclear Cloud Chamber","unixReviewTime":1491004800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_370"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816yPcEEvjL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"01 16, 2016","reviewerID":"AKCPXU46KZIY7","asin":"B0074VCMFE","reviewerName":"TJ Land","reviewText":"Cool item!

None of the adhesive sheets were damaged during the shipping process such as foldes. This is great since my application need to the adhesive to be flat and not curled from being wrapped in a tube shape.\n\nI had an easy time removing the adhesive from the backing sheet but had problems applying the thin adhesive layer to the build plate without getting pockets of air trapped. What I ended up doing was getting a needle and puncturing the large air pockets. The next time I need to apply this adhesive to something I will try the soap water technique that is used for applying car window tinting. When I get around to trying this I will probably write an updated review.\n\nThe adhesive seem to be very sturdy and strong as it is very hard to remove it from objects. This is good for my application because I cant have my build plate moving or warping during one of my 3d prints. Update from a couple of months of usage on my printer. With all the heat and stress of the warping abs that was done to the adhesive it seems to be holding up strong without any problems. I can safely say that it is a very strong adhesive that seems to be of very high quality. I will be changing my build plate with a new material soon and hope that it will be easy enough to remove it from the metal base plate. Update I found that using isopropyl alcohol helped me to remove the adhesive from my build plate but your experience will probably differ from my one.\n\nOverall a fantastic adhesive that can be trusted through heating processes. I would recommend those who are looking for a double sided adhesive pad to buy this one. Especially if you want to use it for a similar usage as me for your 3d printer.

Lonie","reviewText":"This was the first full spool of filament I've used when I bought my first 3d printer (Printrbot Simple Metal) earlier this year.  After trial and error I had it printing very nicely.  When the spool ran out I decided to try a different no-name brand and boy was that a mistake; I had nothing but problems with it and couldn't wait to run out of it (too cheap to just toss it).  For my third spool I came back to this exact brand and color, and couldn't be happier.  I have since upgrade my Printrbot to the official heated bed with kapton tape and the parts have been sticking TOO well!\n\nThe only minor issue I have with this filament is the spider-webiness of some areas when the hot end has to travel back and forth a lot.  This is extremely minor though, as the \"webs\" just brush off fairly easily.\n\nI am sure I will continue to use this filament brand well into the future.\n\nFor anyone interested, I have good results with my Printrbot Simple Metal w/ heated bed with the following settings: Layer Height: 0.2mm, First Layer Height = 0.25mm, Vertical Perimeters = 2, Horizontal Top Shell = 4, Horizontal Bottom Shell = 3, Filament Diameter = 1.73mm, Extrusion Multiplier = 0.9, Extruder Temp = 200c, Bed Temp = 65c, Cooling = 100% after the first layer, First Layer Width = 110%, Top Solid Infill Width = 0.2mm, Retraction Length = 2mm, Lift Z = .35mm, Min Travel After Retraction = 2mm.\n\nUpdate:\n  The inner diameter of the spool (where the filament is coiled) is quite a bit smaller than I would like.  This causes the last 15% or so of filament to have a fairly tight constant curve that can make printing more difficult.  It was also surprisingly brittle at that point; I would come back to a print and find the filament had snapped, once in two different places (right above the extruder and right after the spool).  Despite that I'll still leave this at 5 stars, though I'm thinking it's more like 4.5 until they at least increase the inner spool diameter.","summary":"After trial and error I had it printing very nicely.

The light from the otoscope has a blue tint and the colors appear flatter (lower apparent CRI - Color Rendition Index) compared to the LED flashlight.  With the flashlight, the skin looks normal and with the otoscope it looks cold and pale.  The LED bulbs with the higher CRI are newer and more expensive, so the manufacturer has slightly older LED bulb technology in this otoscope.  This is significant because it is harder to make out subtle signs of conditions if the colors are not as vibrant.\n\nOther reviewers noticed the same blue LED tint, for example the previous review here from Kenneth S. Raper, MD where he writes \"Also the LED is blue-ish instead of white. Very much like the first generation of 'white' LED string Christmas lights that had a blue tint. This makes eardrums and mucous membranes look odd. It makes it difficult to tell how red a throat is, or if an eardrum is a little red or not. Normal pink mucosa (in a blue-ish light) has a slight purple-ish hue. This is really the only disappointment with the product, but it is significant. I expected a white light.\"\n\nI wanted to like this product because the price is good, but I'm returning this for a different brand with a halogen bulb for more accurate color.\n\nThe product package says \"Designed in Texas and manufactured exclusively for Innovative Innovations Inc. in China.\"\n\nUpdate: after I posted this review, the manufacturer posted messages trying to attack me on a personal level simply because I didn't like the blue LED.  Then I went through other 1, 2, star reviews and found the same rude behavior from the manufacturer in the follow-up comments to legitimate reviews from doctors and nurses.  A quick web search reveals that this company has highly aggressive marketing tactics for low quality Chinese medical knockoffs, with an F rating from the Better Business Bureau.\n\nSome useful information on the Amazon Customer Discussion forums:\n\n- \"Always read the negative reviews. Many fraudsters will post hundreds of positive reviews, but the truth can be hidden in that one genuine negative review thread.\"\n\n- \"Always check the time frame of the reviews. Were the majority of positive reviews written over the course of a very short period of time? This is a red flag.\"\n\n- \"Compare the number of reviews with similar, well-known products.

After reading all of the 1k+ reviews for this (it's the same as the model 6565A that is just another color) and going through all the answered questions, I'm pretty happy that I made this choice. Another reviewer called this \"a beast\" because of how well it cleans and they are so right!\nPROS: 1 - This is not a quiet machine but it is not as loud as I expected from a couple of other reviews. My cheap little Dirt Devil is just as loud and doesn't pick up anything but surface debris. The suction is amazing. You only have to choose the correct floor height setting. My carpet was dingy from spot cleaning, then using a low power vacuum. After a year's worth of hidden dirt, this vac really dug down and grabbed all kinds of dander-like debris. I'm sure this will be good for my breathing. You can see in the photo what I picked up with the Bissell after already having gone over the carpet 3 times with the Dirt Devil. Basically, my carpets have never been vacuumed!\n2- It's not as heavy as some reviewers mention. Even on the lowest floor height setting, I had no problems using this (and I have back problems and low strength).\n3- The cord is long enough that I don't' have to unplug when moving around my small apartment.\n4 - There was no \"spit-back\" of debris like with some vacs.\n5 - That dust canister is awesome! So easy to take off, dump, then reattach. That was a relief because emptying the dirt is my least favorite part of vacuuming.\n6 - This wasn't too hard to put together. (You can see the attached photo for what it looked like out of the box and unassembled.) I timed myself and finished in just under 20 minutes. The only problem I had was that my eyes are not great and I took a lot of time re-reading the steps in the instructions. HINT: turn your vacuum around so that it matches the diagram in the instructions!\n7- This maneuvers well enough for an upright. I did have to be careful to use both hands to stretch the hose when using attachments so I didn't yank the vacuum over.\n8 - This fits in my entryway closet very easily (SEE PIC). When you live in a small apartment, storage is at a premium. I like that this stores where I can just roll it out to use it and put it back out of the way.\n\nCONS: 1- The power button is in an odd spot. Like I said, I have back problems and I had to bend to reach the button. I understand why it's placed there though because of how the hose and the release take up the spaces at the bottom.\n2- The hose could be a tad bit longer. It's long enough when the vac is not running, but the suction compresses it and I needed to use both hands to pull it to full length.\n\nI really love this on Day 1. As someone else reviewed that if this lasts a year, I will be more than happy.  One tip I want to pass along is that the Bare Floor setting is also okay for very low carpets. It says that in the manual, but I somehow missed it. I picked up a lot more dirt when I lowered the head.\n\nI included some Before and After photos of the carpet so you could get an idea of how well the vac cleaned it. I took one of them last night and one today so they might not line up properly, but there is a HUGE difference.\n\nBy the way, I went for the Teal color but, to tell the truth, I don't really pay that much attention to it now that I have it. This is the best vacuum I have ever used and my brother has one of the famous high-end ones that I can't even afford to borrow lest I break it! This one works just as good - although it's a bit louder.","summary":"Excellent!

I was shocked at how much this picked up from my clean floors. I have attached the picture of what came up from just our 20 x 15 living room. My neat freak, germophobe self nearly fell over!

Erickson","reviewText":"When you buy a vacuum at this price point, you have to remember...it's at this price point for a reason.\n\nThe Bissell Cleanview Bagless Upright Vacuum arrived and I had it up and running it about five minutes. Assembly was simple, you screw on the handle. You attach the hose. You plug it in. It comes with a couple accessory pieces, nothing too fancy, typical vacuum hose attachments. Upon first use I will say I WAS impressed with the suction and amount of pet hair it got off my bedroom rug. Mind you, I vacuum in there every 3-4 days. I have to. This pulled up as much pet hair and other junk as my Dyson and Electrolux canister vacuums both do.\n\nThat said, as I am used to a Dyson {the twisty flexible ballerina of a vacuum who dances around corners with the twist of my wrist} and my Electrolux canister vacuum {which I can maneuver under my short modern couch with incredible ease as it has the profile of a plank when I get down low}--this Bissell was a CHUNK of CLUNK to move around.\n\nI'll explain: It doesn't maneuver well. It doesn't go under things well. It doesn't play nice with furniture. It is not easy to push around, turn, and be in the same room with. A lot of more affordable vacuums are like this, however, and it is to be expected. You get what you pay for. My Dyson and Electrolux cost several times what this vacuum does. So as far as suction and pick-up, this vacuum was just as good, it just didn't get in all the nooks, crannies, and corners like my less affordable vacuums can. I tried going under my (high IKEA) bed and no...it wouldn't go under it, it just started tipping back and the front part lifted, which basically renders it useless as a vacuum when the front suction end starts lifting off the floor once you start to dip the handle.\n\nSo I think, at this price point, this is a great vacuum for someone who:\n\n1) Is in the market for an affordable vacuum.\n2) Doesn't need a lot of intense, deep vacuuming.\n3) Doesn't have a large home, stairs, or tons of pets and furniture to get under and around.\n\nIf you're a younger person, setting up home and need a basic vacuum for a basic flat or space, then this will do just fine. It picks up well. It doesn't maneuver well. The price is great. I like the teal color and the clear canister, which is easy to open and empty, and oh-so-pleasant to see how much dirt and dander collects in there. That's always my favorite part.\n\nI can't necessarily recommend this vacuum to everyone, you'll have to decide for yourself if it will suit your needs based on what I've shared.","summary":"Will this work for your space and vacuuming needs?

I have a battery-operated stick vac which is super portable, lightweight, and easy to use. However, the suction is not great, and after vacuuming I often have the feeling that I'm not really sucking up all the dust and dirt. Additionally, rechargeable batteries crap out over time and now it holds a much shorter charge. I decided it was time to get a new vacuum; I wanted something that would have excellent suctioning power. After realizing I was not going to find the same performance in a cordless battery-operated vaccuum as in a corded vacuum, I decided to sacrifice the ease of use for better performance. I think this is an excellent vacuum with several pros and some cons:\n\nPROS:\n-has insanely strong suctioning ability. The first time I vaccuumed my small 1 bedroom apartment, I had almost a completely full dirt trap! The suction was so strong that it actually pulled up the carpet from the ground (even though it's wall to wall and tacked down).\n-There is a bagless dirt trap that is easy to empty with a see-through plastic housing so you can easily tell when it needs to be dumped out.\n-It's not any louder than other vacuums I've owned\n-It really is ONE-pass. Unlike my cordless stick vac that I'd have to go over the same spots a few times, this really sucks up everything in one pass. No need to waste time going back and forth and back and forth.\n\nCONS:\n-There is no automatic cord retractor, you must manual wind up the cord when you're done. Not a big deal, but certainly not as convenient as stepping on a switch and having it retract automatically\n-The cord tends to get in the way, so I have to hold onto it while vacuuming to prevent vacuuming over the cord constantly\n\nThere is a foam 'filter' that can be reused and also a paper air filter that according to the owner's manual should be replaced every 3-6 months. If the suction starts decreasing, it's time to change the filter. I'm not crazy about having to replace filters, and I might not have chosen to buy this vacuum had I known there was a filter that would need regular replacing. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nOverall, I am extremely impressed with the suction power in this $63 vacuum - it's much better than what I would expect from a budget vac. Since my priorities were (1) strong suction, and (2) low price, I don't mind the trade-offs (annoying cord, bulkier/heavier machine compared to cordless stick-vac. Depending on what your priorities are, you may feel differently. For the price, I think the performance really can't be beaten.","summary":"Insanely strong suction and an unbeatable price makes up for annoying cord and bulkiness","unixReviewTime":1501200000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_426"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71reGWmCFNL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WeFkeQNBL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BUyT60KIL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Pxv0NTzoL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rsA5GfhWL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MLQiN7vSL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818XAtP78zL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"78","verified":true,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2015","reviewerID":"AQHFH0L76GOPB","asin":"B00AZBIZTW","style":{"Color:":" Purple","Style Name:":" Vacuum Only"},"reviewerName":"Oliver","reviewText":"Got this Bissell OnePass vacuum to replace a Shark wireless vacuum that had a dead battery that cost too much to replace.

Only difference will be on hard floor. The rolling brush cannot be turned off, so on hardwood floor you cannot roll the vacuum forward on the dirt.

With the introduction of Taulman 618 nylon, that is no longer the case. Parts printed with this material can be 80-100% as strong as injection-molded ones.\n\nChanges to my normal ABS workflow on my Afinia printer were minimal. I purchased the recommended Garolite sheet and temperature-lowering attachment from Octave Systems. The Garolite is a lot thicker than the perfboard I usually use so I had to reset my initial platform height. I had to leave a bigger-than-usual gap (about 0.5mm) between the nozzle tip and the bed or else the feed stepper would jam, possibly due to the viscosity of nylon being different from that of ABS during extrusion. The temperature-lowering gizmo must be used if you're printing with an Afinia, since the 618 nylon likes a 240 degree C extrusion temperature and the Afinia doesn't have user-adjustable temp. I also opened my fan duct damper since the nylon seems to print better that way, whereas I've been keeping it closed for ABS lately for maximum part strength. I always print with a raft, so bed leveling is not super-critical for me; I didn't even bother re-leveling.\n\nThe material unfortunately does not come on a \"real\" spool, but rather in a sort of clamshell thing where the filament comes out of a zigzag seam between the two halves of the clamshell. OK, seems reasonable, by why on earth haven't they punched a hole in the middle to act as a hub?!? I cut my own hub hole, stuck a piece of PVC tubing in it, and it seems to be working ok, but I'd much rather have a genuine spool and I'd much rather buy 1kg of it than 1 lb.\n\nThe parts are unbelievable. Beautiful, smooth, even, glossy finish and incredible strength. It's not just that the raw material is stronger than ABS, but the layer-to-layer bonding strength is vastly higher, resulting in parts that do not de-laminate nearly as easily under stress. Another plus is nylon's flexibility, for things like living hinges. ABS gets stress marks and quickly cracks, but nylon is far more durable under repeated flexure.\n\nSupport removal from parts printed on the Up is only slightly more difficult than ABS; due to nylon's greater strength and flexibility; support doesn't \"pop\" off like ABS support does. There's also a bit of extra cleanup required due to nylon's \"stringiness\" - they do make clothing and carpeting out of the stuff, after all! Nonetheless, using the most recent (1.18 at the time of this writing) Afinia software, support removal is trivially easy.\n\nColors are not available, but the natural nylon can be dyed with Rit clothing dyes, either before or after printing. Maximum strength is achieved by dyeing after printing.\n\nUpdate  - this material now comes on a traditional-type spool, hurray! The hub diameter is different from any other spool I have, but that's not a big deal. Much better than the clamshell thing.","summary":"A Complete Game-Changer","unixReviewTime":1361404800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_442"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61r+FOXPd5L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"11","verified":true,"reviewTime":"12 8, 2014","reviewerID":"AS4JFWR1OFWYW","asin":"B00BMLCGF8","style":{"Size:":" stc-1000"},"reviewerName":"Benzo","reviewText":"Worked awesome as a temp controller form my fermentation chamber.

I was kind of done with PLA until Xperland advertised this more precise extruded PLA. Here is what I found..\nFirst the bad. I think the cardboard box isn't needed unless Amazon requires it. The spool itself is made from plastic and vacuum packed with desiccant. That wrapped in an amazon box would have been enough packaging in my opinion. I have seen some spools made from cardboard. This might be a more eco option. I should mention the plastic used for the spool is able to be recycled.\n\nNow the good.  The claim of uniformity seems to be holding true.  I ran a few calibration prints and then printed a mount for my Sirius radio and spot measured the plastic as it fed in. I never measured more than 0.01mm thicker or thinner(1.74-1.76mm).  The finish is shiny like PLA should be. The layers formed nicely and I didn't have any bubbling from the extruder. I ran my extruder at 220c(10c higher than recommended) but this is characteristic of my printer. Every material runs better 10c higher for whatever reason.  I'm using a PEI covered bed and set that to 65c. All in all I'm happy with this PLA. I had stopped using it because of the bubbling I kept getting from other brands. Even name brands. If you want some reliable Filament for a finicky extruder or just some clean and honest PLA you can't go wrong here.\n\nHere is a video of the PLA in action on my CTC Bizer .","summary":"Very reliable PLA.

Also, it doesn't pick up larger items (like popcorn or cheerios) unless you use hose attachments, but then it gets clogged.  Also it doesn't have that little hook thing to clip the cord into while you are vacuuming (a small thing I know but still, I like that hook).  Advantages are good suction and someone the design doesn't suck up the rope edges of my carpet and get all tangled.  There are three attachments that come with the vacuum and after much heming and hawing I figured out that they DO all attach - one attaches to the end of the power cord (when not in use of course) and the other two go on the sides.

So I searched and researched and stumbled upon this commercial KitchenAid. What a great find!\n\nThis mixer is similar in size to the Professional 600 that we also considered. It is almost 17 tall, so it fits perfectly under the cabinet (and it looks fantastic too, orange cord included - tucked away in the back). And because it doesnt tilt, I can keep it in one position and never move it (the Hamilton - a tilt head model - we needed to take out every time as we couldn't tilt it under the cabinet). Also, the 8qt bowl is big (or at least that's my impression after switching from a 4.5qt one), but it is mostly tall. It is so tall in fact that there are issues adding ingredients - when we use this bowl we always have to lower it to add ingredients.

I'm about to order one for my sister-in-law and surprise her with it. She saw me using this on my plants and went gaga. I have switched to using this one on my hair and face (adding some essential oils) and need one for the plants again. So I'm ordering TWO more - one for the SIL and another for myself. By the way, I see where some people wonder whether or not you can use oils in this. I have used thin essential and carrier oils so far, but no heavier ones like olive oil or anything that might clog the sprayer. When I get the next one, I will risk experimenting with something heavier. This sprayer is so perfect or dampening my hair for styling or my skin for cooling off. My plants are probably mad that I quit using it on them!\n\nI'm going to hold back a star just because there are no instructions. I was scared to open it because the top was not easy to get off and I thought I'd break it. Thankfully another reviewer (Robert G) explained it. He also warned that it would take several pumps before the unit was primed and would spray. Basically, I had to grasp the bottom firmly and twist the top piece just enough for it to come loose. Once it's open, you will see the unique spray mechanism. I filled with filtered water, re-attached the top (being careful) and then I had to pump about 10+ times before I got the first partial spray. A couple more pumps and the sprayer was misting as it should. When I sprayed my plants, I realized that I had to stand back a little or the water would drip from the leaves. I ended up holding the sprayer up in the air over the foliage and spraying so that the mist would fall toward the plants. On my hair, it was easier to hold the sprayer a little closer to the target.\n\nAs far as the sprayer itself, this is the first time I'm using it and, so far, so good. I was expecting a longer spray for each pump because the description made it sound like the spray would be \"continuous\". I love the extremely fine mist. With my afro-natural hair, I am glad to be able to moisturize for detangling without over-saturating the hair.\n\nBack to the lack of information included, I still am curious about some things. For instance, can I put certain things in it without ruining the mechanism? I'm sure that thin fluids (essential oils, diluted conditioner, and other products) will spray all right, but I don't know if they will eventually damage the pump. I'm going to check around and see if I can get some answers.\n\nBottom line: as of this first days' use, I'm happy with the basic function but would have appreciated some kind of instructions or Do's and Dont's.","summary":"***UPDATE***NO instructions for a great product","unixReviewTime":1524268800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_474"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jDOS+5PKL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GgFgiiFmL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kX2awSRiL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714hLxh7JjL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nZiOtkLJL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AJfvjADiL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RX8doh14L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EDMatvPjL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Y09ACv0xL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717LUIHDj4L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QzbUeHdUL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E31F9goSL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61y8bdP6B5L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ioId00OtL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71re0Xj6IEL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LXxcfxO1L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"9","verified":false,"reviewTime":"10 11, 2016","reviewerID":"A23P5BO1UGNIRR","asin":"B00DAITFOG","reviewerName":"KC","reviewText":"This is an easy-to-use hand-held radiation detector, simple for a non-professional like myself.

Both measure Beta, Gamma, and X-Ray radiation, and, as advertised, this RD1212 is faster! The RD1212 gives an initial reading in approx. 10 seconds, while the RD1503+ gives an initial reading in about 14 seconds. The full readings, which appear to be within approx. .05 microSv (if that) of the initial readings in difference (just my non-scientific observation), are a more significant amount of time- about one minute apart, with the RD1212 finishing first. Both are ridiculously easy to use, in that you basically add the included batteries (2-AAAs) and press the ON (largest) button on the lower right hand side. That's it. Both have audio and/or vibration alarms pre-set to a threshold of .3 microSv, but are adjustable, and both have back-lighting options to see the screens in lower light settings.\n\nThe RD1212, unlike the RD1503+, has the ability to record and store your data points onto a PC (comes with a Mini-USB-B plug- not Micro) using downloadable software from QuartaRad's website, and you can interactively plot and share your readings on a map with other individuals using the same software/ devices worldwide. The RD1212 also shows the threshold alarm level on the main screen itself (vs. inside the menu for the RD1503+), and has several language options (Russian, English, French, German, Japanese). The RD1503+ appears to be sold (in the US at least) with English only, but does give the option to use older micro Roetgens per hour as the unit of measure. I looked on the specs for both the RD1212 and the RD1503+on the QuartaRad site and there are minor discrepancies between the included paper technical specs that come with the devices and the specs listed on the website, such as some commas instead of periods for decimals, or minor discrepancies in energy ranges registered (\"0,4 to 3,5\" MeV for beta radiation on RD1212's paper specs vs. \"0.25- 3.5\" on the website), but i'm not sure how much that would matter to the causal user anyways. Perhaps the biggest differences I noticed in the specs between the two devices is that the RD1212 has a \"Range of Indications\" of 0.05-999.00 microSv/h (per website), whereas RD1503+ shows 0.05- 9.99 (also website). The uninterrupted operation time is no less than 300 hours for the RD1212, and 550 hours for the RD1503+. This RD1212 costs about $50 more than the RD1503+, but depending on your needs, either device is suitable.\n\nAnother curiosity/ feature is that you can also use this RD1212 precision machine as a... flashlight....heh, maybe the engineers have an answer for this, but it seemed to me to be as random a feature as if this also doubled as an oven-timer or something like that. For fun, I looked up in Wikipedia, the \"Banana Equivalent Dose (BED), [which] is an informal expression of ionizing radiation exposure, intended as a general educational example to indicate the potential dose due to naturally occurring radioactive isotopes by eating one average-sized banana. One BED is often taken as 0.1 Sv\" To check this, i took a measurement using both the RD1212 and the RD1503+- as you can see from my pic, yep, the devices next to my bananas registered very much in that range- about 0.08-.11 microSv in my four trials.\n\nI mentioned this in my RD1503+ review, but check your old watches. I wrote that there are watches from the mid-20th century (pre-1960s) that were made with radium dials- my husband collects many antique watches, and measured one watch with a reading of .84 - in the \"Alert\" zone, which the RD1503+ manual says should be avoided. There is also an incredible story on the quartarad website where a traveler measured upper 90s-100s microSvs in his hotel hallway, to find that the guy in the room next door had just had returned from the hospital after a radioactive therapy treatment for thyroid cancer. Apparently, the ionized radiation levels emanating from such patients can last weeks, even after the end of treatment! The traveler asked for a different room.\n\nThese are great devices, and they bring some peace of mind.","summary":"Give Yourself Some Peace of Mind","unixReviewTime":1476144000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_475"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qrMitALpL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"06 18, 2016","reviewerID":"A1VGXHHR08G044","asin":"B00DHLRO1C","style":{"Size:":" 6 In","Style:":" 36+"},"reviewerName":"D.

Its an awesome instrument to have because you can use it to measure temperatures when you actually have a need for it (or you can play around with it by pointing it inside your refrigerator, on hot stove element etc to entertain!!).\n\nI really like it and would like to break my review in pros and cons of the Lasergrip 800:\nPROS:\n1. First up, it feels good in hand. The plastic its made of is good quality, its ergonomic to handle and its pretty light-weight.\n2. I tried it on multiple things (water at different temperatures) with a thermometer dipped in it and the temperature was with agreement with what was shown on thermometer (plus/minus 1oC).\n3. It has a range of -50 to 750oC, which pretty much covers everything under the sun (but not the sun of course ;).\n4. It show temperature in Fahrenheit as well as Centigrade, saving you the time to use an app to convert ;)\n5. The display is big with huge, easy to read letters (photos attached). It can be backlit for easy reading, if using the Lasergrip at night.\n6. It takes 9-volt battery (instead of a AA battery) that means it lasts longer and you won't have to worry about changing the batteries too often.\n7. There is not off switch and it switches off after a few seconds of inactivity, thus extending the battery life even more.\n8. One of the good things I liked is that it comes with a detailed manual (photos attached) and one can easily get to know how to use the instrument.\n9. The price is worth for such an instrument.\n\nCONS:\n1. Size of the lasergrip is a bit on larger side. Would have been good to have it a little smaller, but that is definitely not a deal breaker\n2. Since it uses laser, its advisable to have a cap on the end that emits laser light, for extra protection.\n\nIn summary, I am glad to have got this and I am enjoying using the laser grip. I would definitely recommend it for a handyman and also to have it at home for personal use if you regularly need it to check tempratures.","summary":"!!!!!!!!

I was expecting it to be good but it stood up to my test. First the thermometer comes packaged in a clamshell  pack that thankfully opens by separating the sides, you don't have to cut it apart and wind up cutting yourself. The first thing you notice is a tag informing you that a battery is packaged inside the device. There is a 9V battery and its wrapped in cellophane so it won't discharge. I unwrapped it hooked it up and set about testing it. There is also an instruction sheet for more detailed knowledge.\n\nMy first test was I pointed the Etekcity (blue/gray) thermometer and my yellow thermometer at my carpet and saw a one degree difference. Not bad at all for a thirty dollar unit, pretty accurate. I upped my testing with my oven set to 400 degrees. I did learn in this test that pointing at my pizza stone yields a higher temperature than the air temperature the oven is set to. At that level I did get a 14 degree difference from yellow. I won't say what yellow is but it would be a fluke if you guessed. I took pictures of my tests with both units pointing to areas next to each other so the temperature would be as close to the same as I could do. I'm very impressed by the closeness at low temps and respectable difference at the higher level.\n\nI like the rugged feel of the thermometer. It has a very clear screen too.

Also, I puchased two and one arrived with a damaged clip. Not the fault of AcuRite. A suggestion I have is to check for accuracy by conducting the salt test. Place salt in the bottle cap (or other small container). Dampen the salt with water. Place both the hygrometer and the bottle cap full of damp salt in a ziploc bag and seal. Keep it like this for  8+ hours.  After 8+ hours the humidity inside the bag will be 75%. Compare it to your hygrometer which should read 75%. If it's off, note how much and in which direction then be sure to add or subtract that amount when reading the hygrometer. Hope this helps.","summary":"Check for accuracy.

Ive changed the Amazon Basics AA battery once, which I do with most of my battery-operated products every 6 or 12 months (especially with smoke detectors/alarms). I don't wait for batteries to die. I appreciate how quickly the readings are available. For instance, I can walk from one part of my first floor home to the other, and see the difference in temperature and humidity readings within seconds. The digital numbers are easy to read as long as I have on my glasses and Im not in the dark. Theres a tiny white button located on the back that les you choose Fahrenheit or Celsius. I would definitely buy this Acurite model again*. I paid $3 more in 2016.\n\nHOW ACCURATE ARE THE READINGS? I can tell if the readings are accurate by comparing different areas of my home where it is obvious (see messy images) that the humidity is really high. In Miami, FL, I doubt Ill ever witness a really low humidity reading room in my old home.  I have a large window that needs to be replaced (the whole darn thing, glass and frame). It allows outside weather conditions (heat and more heat) to seep right into my home. Yep, already added that ugly and cheap plastic sheeting over the frame, but its not helping enough.\n\nWHY I BOUGHT THIS: I use this meter, mostly it seems, just to annoy myself. LOL!  Im not using for growing indoor plants or any other casually scientific reason. I just like to know why I feel like crapnothing escapes the effects of dampness in the air, the dampness that can easily make me feel miserable, the dampness that requires me to cleanly wipe down even more crap. On a positive note, its easy to turn on the air conditioner (sometimes using the free air circulation) to help reduce these issues. Until I can find a person willing to empty bins of water for me every single day, I cant be bothered with dehumidifiers. Nobody in their right mind leaves stagnant water in Miami (mosquitos will find it).\n\nFor those trying to learn the most basic humidity examples: Very low humidity can cause dry skin, nosebleeds, and who knows what else. Very high humidity can help improve plant growth, improve mold growth (you don't want that), but can also cause a person to feel uncomfortable and/or sweaty.\n\n(*) AcuRite 00613 Humidity Monitor with Indoor Thermometer, Digital Hygrometer and Humidity Gauge Indicator","summary":"1 year and 8 months later, maintains accuracy.","unixReviewTime":1514505600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_491"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812-Xez8MJL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BoXiMyicL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719WVLpoUYL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"11 25, 2017","reviewerID":"A2U8YO765V8PGU","asin":"B00DRALJ28","reviewerName":"SMplicity","reviewText":"Great little accurate device.

It is incredibly reliable and I consistently print for 10+ Hrs between bed swaps and run two of these batches daily.\n\nThe perf-board beds make all the difference. They require no maintenance and are easy to remove parts from. You get 3 and this allows for rapid swaps. The printer software even has a \"print again\" command that simply repeats the print. You need a computer to do send the command, but you don't have to re-send the file which means less time spent near the printer.\n\nFrom what I gather this printer works best with ABS. The only negative reviews seem to be with PLA. I don't print in PLA ever, but can imagine problems arising when switching between the two filaments, especially when the perf-board is considered\n\nIve used a Lulzbot Taz 4.0 and have to say, without this printer I would have thought ABS was impossible to print with. This situation is more of a complete failing of lulzbot with their hot ends (purchased January 2015 and it is incapable of printing in ABS). That printer is over $2k so I was sure it was a failing of the material. If you get the UPmini, say goodbye to wholesale delamination and parts detatching from the bed or preparing the bed in whatever way.\n\nABS printing IS DANGEROUS in terms of fumes. The enclosure seems to cut down on some of the smell. I added a little carbon scrubber on the top of the machine (See picture) This seems to help a lot in reducing the smell.

(ie. If you plan to leave this device for more than a few minutes, the device auto powers off.)\n3) For the ADVANCED BAFX3608 dBA/dBC meter, the unit does not allow the users to specify the initial on state of the readings.  For example, the unit defaults to dBA and fast reading when initially turned-on.  I prefer to always take readings using dBC and slow, mainly dBC as this tends to detect the lower frequency range better than dBA and selecting slow/average readings to average in anomalies versus readily seeing a distracting spiked sound anomaly.  Likely when recording, the slow reading option maybe more desirable unless you're trying to monitor for very short bursts of sounds such as gun shots, and then faster readings are desired in order to capture the short bursts of sound.\n4) For the ADVANCED BAFX3608 dBA/dBC meter, although already heavily specified Windows Only software, such a simple device should be able to output using libUSB (and likely does so already) simple streams of data that can be easily piped into a text file for graphing by other open sourced tools.

USB Vendor Device ID is 64bd:74e3 \"SM\".)\n5) For the ADVANCED BAFX3608 dBA/dBC meter, the hardware manual states possible to  sync the time with the computer when connected via USB, but no option appears to exist.\n6) For the ADVANCED BAFX3608 dBA/dBC meter, a pamphlet packaged with the device gives a download URL for downloading a copy of the software (eg. SLVersion2.exe), but this is really an old copy of the software dated 2015.10.07, and the newest version (as of this writing) is already packaged inside the box of the device, using a small mini CDROM.  (The version on the mini CDROM is SoundLabSetup20160720.exe, or dated 2016.07.20)\n\nWould really be nice to have a USB feature for computer logging, or memory for logging, and easily transferring (regardless of operating system) to a computer for hard copy.  (This feature is now implemented within the larger Advanced BAFX Decibel Meter.)\n\nNOTES: The ADVANCED BAFX3608 dBA/dBC meter contains a usb SILICON LABS C8051F320 8051 8-bit Microcontroller hub chip, with the firmware registering the device under Windows' Device Manager as both, a HID-COMPLIANT DEVICE and USB INPUT DEVICE.  The device's USB product vendor and model USB id's are 64bd:74e3 \"SM\".  The device contains a likely closed soure firmware, likely incorporating some minimal addressing with arguments commands to initiate retrieving recorded records, ordering the device to start sending live data, and commands for getting the current time and sending the current time.  If I had more time, I would provide some C code to perform these functions, but this is tedious work versus having the specifications or already written code.  The hardware manufacturer should be providing the firmware specifications (eg. PDF) for communicating to the device via ASM/C programming code. (eg. Uniden provides specifications for their firmware used on their hardware products, although sometimes difficult to find.)\n\nATTACHED: Attaching an image comparing an apparently older basic BAFX sound decibel meter alongside the newer larger BAFX sound decibel meter.","summary":"Works for me!","unixReviewTime":1441411200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_518"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612aZouuckL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"07 5, 2017","reviewerID":"A3SDLKLNAR38ZL","asin":"B00EDMHKYU","style":{"Size Name:":" #9"},"reviewerName":"Southern Family","reviewText":"Great wood screws!

I have had it going 2 weeks straight and working almost constantly.  The latest V4 hotend is great!  I was going to make my own until I took a closer look and realized it would be difficult to improve upon outside of special applications and without a lot of effort and cost.\n\nMay I strongly recommend to all who own this excellent printer a very useful upgrade:\n\nUsed this: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RTGDKU?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s02\n\nand a http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A9N1D5E?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_71\n\nfor a z-stop upgrade to make it much easier to adjust.  I thought of other ways to do it but this works so well and was so so easy!  That little default z-stop bolt and I did not get along.  I hated it.  I get the point of it's placement and design but it was a pain to adjust, access, and do anything with.  That is just my opinion and like I said I get it and don't blame Makergear for the design decision.\n\n  I measured this to be similar/slightly shorter than the stock bolt it came with.  I put this product with the larger head upward to contact the switch and I used the other product I linked below the tapped hole in the aluminium plate.\n\nJust in case you are doing unusual stuff with your print bed:  You Probably can't use more than a 3/8\" thick bed if you ever tried to replace the glass with something that thick.\n\nThis printer deserves is reputation!  It is solid, reliable, and well designed.  Most of all aside from the reviews what made sense to me is that if you are going to adjust a printbed and calibrate your prints where distances of under .1mm can matter.  (Or a fraction the width of a hair) do you really want to even try to do that with a wooden framed, cheap, low quality printer?  I don't!  Getting the software/slicer settings dialed in isn't a walk in the park and there are plenty of other little tasks that are frequent to 3d printing and I don't think it is worth anyone's time or frustration to deal with any more than they absolutely have to!  I have hundreds and hundreds of hours on this printer and it has been reliable, not jams, clogs, blockages, or other issues.  I have heard and read very good things about the company's support but I have not had to ask them for any help with anything so far.  (I bought mine directly from Makergear and it shipped quickly and was packed well.  )\n\nOne more well intended and hopefully helpful product tip for M2 users:  It isn't the cheapest thing but I can't imagine not having a \"zebra plate\" print bed.  I ordered it directly from the OEM from their site.  I don't think it is available from Amazon but I could be wrong or that could change.  The stock glass is best for some things but I needed to print some larger 7+ inch diameter round rigid structurally stable prints in ABS and other materials and the zebra plate is so perfect.  I have been gentle with it and tried to dial in the proper 1st layer reduced height sometimes to squish things on there when I need to but wow....it is so worth it's rather comparatively intimidating price.  Things stick on and they come off wonderfully when you get the hang of it which is fast and easy.  The stock glass is great, the zebra plate was just different.  I will try other plates and update if I find something I like as much as I like those two options.  I haven't tried it with nylon yet, so I have no idea if it works for that.\n\nI hope the other product info is helpful, I have always found extremely helpful reviews and user tips on Amazon and wanted to contribute what made my printing experience much better in combination with this printer.","summary":"If you think the z-stop could be easier to adjust and want to upgrade it read on!","unixReviewTime":1454198400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_525"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jr5MdHRYL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HSeD1PskL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514fQ8X7m5L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hLmhwcu4L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5105N+2aLPL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"16","verified":false,"reviewTime":"03 3, 2015","reviewerID":"A9DH6MLZBGUMO","asin":"B00ELUOERA","reviewerName":"Jules","reviewText":"This is an excellent machine for you if you are just getting started in 3D printing.\n\nThe M2 is solid as a rock. The supports are all steel and the rails are heavy aluminum, it's built in the USA, and although some of the plastic covers and knobs are actually printed on the machine, they are quite sturdy. The machine weighs in at about 30 pounds or so, making it very stable. If you are a mechanically-minded sort you can buy the kit for a few hundred bucks less, but I do recommend letting them build your machine for you.  They will test it completely and use it to print out (some extremely excellent) samples before they send it to you, so you are assured of having everything calibrated correctly, and they do a much better job of wrapping wires up and making everything look tidy than a beginner would be able to do. The packaging is excellent, there was no need to adjust anything out of the box. Just check the calibration and get on down the road.\n\nOn the minus side, it's rather a noisy little thing. (Not a dealbreaker though. Earplugs.)\n\nWhen I spend this much money on anything, customer service is a critical component, and frankly it's part of what I'm paying for.  The MakerGear support is superior, period. I had two questions/issues after office hours, but I got a response on each of them, not the next day as I was expecting, but once within a couple of hours, and once within about five minutes. And they actually followed up. These guys REALLY care about their product and they want their customers to have a good experience. It shows.\n\n(They also carry all of the parts for their machines in-house, and don't have to wait for delivery from beyond Timbuktu.)\n\nThe MakerGear Forum is a goldmine. There are guys there who have been doing this from the get-go, and they are very patient with what must be the thousandth time that they've had to answer the same questions. That kind of resource is invaluable, and again, it's part of what you are paying for.  I highly recommend checking out the forum for more information on the M2.\n\n(Couple of samples of the output are shown in the photos.  Quality of the prints is excellent, even from a complete beginner.)\n\nUpdate: 3/7/2016\n\nComing up on a year of ownership now, and you wouldn't recognize the initial machine.  It's been upgraded twice, and is now a Dual Extruder M2, which increases the pure \"fun\" level exponentially.  I tend to print with PLA (or other low temp filaments) out of one nozzle, and PETG (or higher temp filaments) out of the other, so it's like having two printers set up and ready to go, with the space requirements of one. (I can also run dissolving filament as support if I want to, or just print a two color print with the same filament type.  Many, many additional options with the dual setup.)\n\nIn all that time, I've only \"had\" to level the machine once, (with a couple of small tweaks as I switched to different plates).  I've never even had any of the printed ABS parts break, after hundreds of prints.  It still puts out \"near\" perfect prints, and the qualifier there is on me, not the machine.  This was definitely one of my \"chose very wisely\" calls.","summary":"Fear not, Beginners!","unixReviewTime":1425340800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_526"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g-v8spiYL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7142lFjionL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711Y3jv34yL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"3","verified":true,"reviewTime":"11 30, 2015","reviewerID":"A32GOCI9S6U7KM","asin":"B00ENF272C","reviewerName":"Friagram","reviewText":"These are decent probes.\n\nThe trim pot on the BNC is the weakest part of these probes.

Now with this Fluke FLK-VT104 I can actually see the regions contributing to heating or cooling losses from across the room!\n\nI posted a couple saved images to the customer photos section.  Here you can actually see where the attic beams are in an uninsulated attic.  These beams provide a tiny bit of insulation so the ceiling directly below the beams appear as blue-purple lines on the VT104.  I wonder if I could use this as a ceiling stud-finder!  This is great in case there are any gaps in the insulation, this tool will find the insulation gaps (easiest to find on the very hot or cold days).\n\nDon't just leave this on the default settings.  Play around with some of the menu settings because you can get dramatically different views using the color palette and image blending %.  Some settings that you can adjust that affect the measurement include the emissivity of the materials and the background temperature.\n\nThe included CD contains the SmartView software to download captured images from the micro SD card.  Don't install the CD but rather download the latest version from the Fluke website (Support / Software Downloads) so that you get the very latest version of the SmartView application.  This allows you to change the color palette and blending (and other image manipulation) after the image capture so you don't have to worry about getting these settings perfect in the field.\n\nThe first thing to do after you open the box and fully charge the device - update the firmware on the Fluke website (Support / Software Downloads), since the device ships with an older firmware.  This is a simple download that you copy onto the micro SD card and then the VT104 will prompt you to update when it powers on.  The firmware contains various improvements to the device features.\n\nI highly recommend the VT104 for pinpointing actual heating and cooling loss locations rather than relying on theoretical data or guesswork.","summary":"Excellent for HVAC trouble spots","unixReviewTime":1399161600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_535"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ct3M3geRL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Iw2cXcGkL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wHr5X5hbL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"5","verified":true,"reviewTime":"05 22, 2015","reviewerID":"A3M16JSEXT9IKR","asin":"B00EW7M5S2","style":{"Style:":" 7445"},"reviewerName":"Deep Thought","reviewText":"As expected.

It was such an incredible tool I bought a Replicator 2 for my house. What can I say? This thing can make almost anything. Well, there is a learning curve to do that. First, this is a revision 1 machine and that means it comes with all the problems a first release will have. Some issues can be as simple as not leveling (tramming) the build plate correctly to machines that are DOA. This is a complicated device with both electronics and mechanical devices that can be knocked out of alignment because of rough shipping. They (Makerbot) were also having teething issues with both machines. Loose screws, random items installed incorrectly, an extruder with a problematic tension system. Here's the thing that I found out when I got mine. Some people have a problem with \"X\" and yet other people never have a problem with \"X\"....the only thing that was repeatable was the Delrin Extruder needed to be upgraded..it was so apparent that Makerbot now sells the upgrade (but aren't putting in the machines yet probably because they need to get rid of parts inventory). There is also a learning curve on the software. You need to be able to use basic CAD. That's the reason you want a 3D printer right? Various CAD out there..some free (Google SketchUp OpenScad) but I like Cubify Invent. $50 is cheap for a full CAD and Invent is great because it was built from the ground up for 3D printing...not designing houses or modify Ford engines. Then you have to have a mechanical bend to you....you can't just sacrifice a chicken and cool parts fall out of the printer.\n\nNow, after all that you're probably thinking \"Wait..he gave it 5 stars?\"\n\nSure did...I own a machine shop with large CNC equipment...but the Replicator is an entirely new way of producing goods. Not only that but I work with CAD all day...so, for me, it's easy to sit down and design art...or print out scanned works of art...or make small parts for around the house...you are (almost) only limited in your imagination. There is also soft rubbery filament you can get, wooden plastic filament, and nylon (STRONG!) filament you can buy. Even though this tech has been around since the 80's and there are professional machines out there that can do incredible things, only within the last few months has their been a product/price point like this. Yes, the kits have been around for a while (2?3? years?) but I wanted something I could take out of the box and learn on. My 2X was making parts from the minute I turned it on. I have sold 2 jobs at work on it and produced in house test jigs for several products we make.\n\nAgain, this is not a magic box that you wave a wand at and loving goodness falls out. This is a tool every bit as useful and complicated as a minature CNC machine. You need a certain skill set or the willingness to learn. If you're an artist you'll need to learn some mechanical skills but I know of 3 people on Google Groups who are already selling original artwork from theirs.\n\n\"Tea, Earl Gray, Hot\" (if you get the reference you need to go order one right now....)","summary":"Makerbot Replicator 2...a creative persons dream machine....","unixReviewTime":1367539200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_546"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61LswSiwQ3L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"09 8, 2016","reviewerID":"A3AIJJOWGLASH7","asin":"B00FKYDD1Y","style":{"Length:":" 10 Pair"},"reviewerName":"Davew","reviewText":"Work GREAT,\ni did not like the U shaped crimp style they have on the back so, I cut off one side, then bent the other over like a circle, I then put in my wires and crimped them and Soldered them..\nThese slide together and lock very nice and seem to hold up well.\nI have 6  different radios, and other irems on my desk i change frequently and this saved a lot of extra wires and plugs that had to be put on the desk.","summary":"These slide together and lock very nice and seem to hold up well.","unixReviewTime":1473292800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_547"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/317TTc0CJsL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/310walGX2CL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"13","verified":true,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2015","reviewerID":"A2V5R832QCSOMX","asin":"B00FN6PBQY","style":{"Color:":" Original Version"},"reviewerName":"Leanne","reviewText":"I hated to pay so much for some simple hooks (and am marking off a star for their cost), but these work really well.

First off, it is very stringy. Complex parts or, parts with lots of holes (like say if you were printing a model of  swiss cheese) are riddled with strings. Iv'e heard printing hotter will help fix this. But I find that many of my pieces look like they've collected cob webs in a attic for 20 years. I've also had some discoloration issues with red. White works really well for me.\n\nSTICKING TO THE BED\nIf you're printing on glass, do not use blue tape. Just use a glue stick straight on the glass. Very important with longer and larger parts to print with brims. After the PVE glue and the brims, simply use a nuclear bomb to separate your print from the print bed.\n\nOTHER THOUGHTS\nIt's expensive, nearly 4x what I'm paying for PLA or ABS. It's very strong. A bit heavy, which also means you get less out of the 1lb spool than a normal 1lb spool. Make sure you visit the made solid PET+ printing tips page.\n\nWHY DO I USE PET+?\nI'm an engineer, I use PET+ because PLA is nearly useless to me as it cannot withstand hardly any heat. ABS prints like junk, so this is sort of the best of both worlds.\n\nCOMMENT IF YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM\nOk so shortly after blowing through a couple of spools my printer was having huge extruding issues. I'm not sure if it's my printer, or if this plastic has jammed my extruder beyond repair.

Now a 5 star.\n\nMonday I received my long awaited printer. I thought I would wait a couple of days until I had some experience and then post my thoughts. My first impressions were quite good. The unit looks good, well built with all wiring cleanly aligned and secured. My unit would not feed the filament at first so I sent an email to support and received a phone call within an hour, not many companies will do that. The support rep Charles and I went through a process of trying some things and finally found the problem with the extrusion head had been knocked off center during shipping. Once that was snapped back into place all worked as it should. My first print (white ABS filament comes with the printer) was their demo part, a miniature bird bath. It came out excellent. I then tried one of my SolidWorks parts saved in STL format and the printed parts came out terrible. Again, I emailed XYZ and received a prompt reply back from Charles to try and correct my STL files with this online free service, SAVE THIS ADDRESS you will need it if using STL files NETFABB CLOUD SERVICE. My parts were uploaded and emailed back to me within 5 minutes. It must be an automated process. You can also download a free program and do your own file corrections, no special talent needed. I then retried my parts and they came out great. This is for a product I am developing for one of my clients and the parts will be made from ABS. I have found standard stereolithography material (STL laser generated parts) are very accurate but 7% heavier than ABS. This product I am designing is very weight sensitive. So I now have all my prototype parts and will be building our first test unit. Here are some things that are not clear in the printer description:.\n\n1. The replacement filament comes in a cartridge not rolls as shown on Amazon. The cartridge is single use and cannot be refilled.\n2. The software does NOT have any drawing capabiliies. You will need a separate program to draw your parts, I use my CAD system SolidWorks.\n3. There are no good instructions on how to use the printer software and what the various options will do to the printed part.\n4. My experience with the support staff was quite good, quick return call and knowledgeable steps.\n5. You will need a set of jewelers files if you want to do detailed touch ups.\n6. Your STL files will most like need to be reformatted by a service such as this; NETFABB CLOUD SERVICE.\n7. My OS is XP (now Win7 Pro). I had difficulties downloading, installing and then running the printer software due to my virus program. I use WebRoot and I had to spend quite some time to finally get it to allow the software to run. If you have problems try disabling your virus software and then enable after loading the printer software.\n\nAfter I ran more parts and received some of the replacement filaments I ordered I will update my review. Right now I am quite pleased with the product. I took a star off due to the lack of operational instructions.\n\n7 Day review:\nI have had my printer for a week and it has run nearly non-stop. Many dozens of prototype parts have been produced for the models I am assembling, all with excellent results. I received a pre-ordered cartridge of black filament and went through the process of removing one filament (the white that came with the printer) and installing the new black cartridge. The process is smooth and without difficulties. To answer a question that had been posted, the printer ships with a 300 gm sample roll of white filament and the replacement cartridges are 600 gm. The printer tracks the filament use by total capacity in meters compared to amount remaining. The 600 gm equates to 240 meters.\n\nThe software has several different settings and trying them all in various combinations would take forever. There should be a manual on what the different settings will do to the finished part, again this is why I took the one star off. From my experience the default settings produce great parts. I have found that when I need more than one of certain part all that needs to happen is click on \"import\" as many times that you want a part and your parts will be staged on the table at the correct distance and placement. This is very helpful to not need to make multiple copies of the part in the original CAD or drawing program. I have made up to eight parts at once from a single design and all came out perfect.\n\nMicrosoft also sponsors a STL file correction service: netfabb.azurewebsites.net/.\n\nExcellent product for the price! If I were still in engineering R&D management I would want one of these for perhaps every 3 engineers. This is a fantastic tool for trial and error and to learn what works.\n\nOne Month review:\nLast one, I promise unless something goes terribly wrong. The printer has been running almost daily with absolutely no problems. I have gone through one and half filament cartridges with no binding, clogs or control issues. As I use the software it has become easier to configure the part for printing. I have needed to tighten the X belt (single screw) once and recalibrate the table perhaps four times. It is a fairly straight forward adjustment but can sometimes take several minutes due to the slow process for the automatic measurements to be read. I would recommend checking calibration before each big printing process. The system needs to heat up anyway so the check is well worth it.\nOne of the components I am making is a thin semi, square tube about  inch per side and 6 inches long. The walls are only 0.06\" thick. The table is usually set up to print four of these at once. We are testing for various length configurations. I am finding the tubes come out absolutely straight for the entire length, no warps, bends or contour issues - as good as stereo lithography. I have also not used glue for the last 4 or 5 dozen parts. Once the bed cools down the parts pop right off. I am very happy with this purchase and it has paid for itself more than two times.\n\n6 month update:\n\nI would like to pass along some things that I have learned and solutions to some issues.\nThe printer has been run hundreds of hours since receipt. I have not experienced any failure, clogs, incomplete prints or any malfunctions - it has worked perfectly. The more I have used it the more I become familiar with how a part must be positioned to avoid warps, slippage or out of round situations.\n\nI have recalibrated the bed many times, usually every 20 or so hours of runtime. The calibration is tedious and time consuming. I have found that many \"999\" error codes are due to the contact on the printer head missing the contact plates on the bed. This is where the \"jog\" command is needed and usually just the X direction. Watch the printer head and contact pin closely during your first calibration to be sure everything is in alignment. I have had to re-tighten the X belt once. If you notice circular parts becoming slightly oval your X belt probably needs to be tightened. XYZ has the procedure on their site.\n\nPositioning of your parts is critical to a good part. Something that may be shaped like a cup should have the open part up even though the original position when imported will place it down.\n\nAn issue that began during the first set of parts is an accumulation of fibers sticking and then hardening on the extruder head. I first used a Dremel tool with a soft wire wheel to remove the hardened filaments but found a better solution.  I have silicone mold release (I use the Sprayon brand, found on Amazon but I am sure others will work as well) to coat the print head once it has been cleaned. The mold release is sprayed onto a Q-tip and coated onto the head. Try to avoid the contact pin but if you do coat it it is easily cleaned with a nail file using a light brush stroke. I have not had the problem since our first coating last March. I first tried a high temperature cooking oil that also worked well but decided on the mold release since it was on hand.\n\nOccasionally I wish to make another part without waiting for the entire cool down cycle to complete. I let the finished part sit on the bed for about 5 minutes, pop it off and then simply turn the machine off, wait for 30 seconds and turn back on to start the next part. I usually do this while everything is still hot and the platform is in the raised position as this also reduces the heat up time. This technique has saved hours.\n\nI have now found that I can get great parts directly from the SolidWorks STL cad files without going through the online correcting process I documented earlier. A lot of this is due to correct positioning of the part. I have seldom needed the \"raft\" or \"supports\" features when setting up the print routine.\nIf you plan to make multiple parts at once you will most likely need to add the \"raft\" call out, particularly if the part foot print is small, i.e.  \" round or square. I have made up to 36 of same part in one run using the \"raft\".\nI am extremely pleased with how this inexpensive machine has performed. If it is still functioning at one year I will update again.\n\nOne Year Follow-up, now 5 stars\n\nI now have a year of use on my machine and the first thing I can say is following hundreds of satisfying builds, nothing has gone wrong. I have not had to replace or repair a single part. The initial setup required technical assistance for resetting the print head but since that simple task the printer has worked perfectly. I have calibrated the table several times and have gotten to a point where I can do this fairly quickly. After a few times you get a better feel for the adjustments. I have tightened the belts once. The parts I have fabricated go from complicated, proprietary prototypes for my clients to simple things used around the home for repairs/replacement of broken or worn out parts.\nAs an example, a close friend has an older home with vintage blinds. The blinds have complicated, plastic end caps that after years had started falling apart. He had one remaining complete part. I scanned the part (both sides) on a paper scanner and saved as JPEG photos. If using a standard scanner with a 3D part you need to do both sides and then combine to provide a complete pattern for your drawing program. I then brought the photos into Photoshop and combined them as one part. The photo was then brought into my CAD system where I merely drew lines and circles shown in the photo to make a 3D part. Obviously some height measurements are added the saved as an STL file. The part was not perfect in the first runs but could easily be modified until the final part is actually better than the original and he could chose colors. We made eighteen beautiful parts. I also made some new hangers for the blinds and increased the thickness where his had been broken and glued several times. (see CAD photos)\nI continue to use the original software, 1.1.29.3 and firmware 1.1. G as I want to use other filaments that XYZ do not offer such as translucent by Zen ToolWorks or the beautiful colors from HatchBox. These require using the XYZ cartridge material with the new material. The technique is quite simple and can be found through a search.\nThe product has proven to be an extremely satisfying experience and has more than paid for itself supporting my consulting business. I highly recommend it. Should you have questions please ask and I will do my best to provide an answer.\n\nTwo year follow-up\nAfter two years the machine continues to run perfectly. I have not had a single part fail or clogged nozzle, amazing. The only negative has been that XYZ secretly changed the software and now I am unable to use filaments from other manufacturers, disappointing but the printer still performs flawlessly. For the price it has been a great purchase.","summary":"I have made many usefull parts.","unixReviewTime":1396396800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_567"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-fBh7DPLL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"3","verified":true,"reviewTime":"05 16, 2015","reviewerID":"A1I0Z1VHJUTQLT","asin":"B00H7VEU0G","reviewerName":"Paul C Skertich","reviewText":"If you're looking at the XYZ Da Vinci 1.0 customer reviews just keep in mind to take reviews at a gain of salt. Yes this product is 500 bucks and yes there are two types PLA and BAS. Whether you're a innovator or whatever and you are contemplating wither to get this - I say go for it! It has less issues than negative reviewers say. When you unbox the product be sure to re-read the instructions and make sure to take out the supports, the tape and everything else the instruction says. Also be sure to make sure when you load the filament go to the Utilities -> Change Cartridge -> Load Filament - if you see filament oozing into the drop box then you're good to go. If you don't try it again and see if you see the filament oozing out. Again just follow the instructions - it doesn't take a brain surgeon. Very easy to use, very easy to set up. Another pointer to point out - make sure you get the latest drivers and software from the website just to be sire. Just Google up the brand name and you should be pointed to their website. Now let's talk about getting your measurements correct - I printed out a door stopper which I took a picture of and hopefully I can share with the rest of you. Whether you're in Autocad or 3DS Max or what not - if you're measurements is in inches - make sure it's in inches when you convert the 3D model to stl file format. When you open their software make sure you right click over the object and click on scale up from mm to inches. It's going to be huge and over the borders giving the object color being red. Now click on the scale transform tool and you can easily adjust to the dimensions of how you desire it to be. It wouldn't hurt to also go to settings in the software and click on printer then make sure the metrics are set to inches. Another thing that may get people twisted in the knot is the coordinate system - when their in the scale dialog - they may notice Z is up and Y is away. If you're a programmers or a 3D artist for a game company or what not - you would probably know some software has the y-z flipped. So the X is to the right, the Y is towards you and Z is up.

It isn't hard at all to do so I don't know why they left them out.

Be careful with it.\n\nThe build itself was fun and not terribly hard.  It took about 6-7 hours straight.  The biggest challenge was just reading the instructions; they can be confusing at times and sometimes the accompanying picture isn't for this printer but for the earlier version.  That can be a bit scary because often times you depend solely on the images and seeing a new item on the printer that you don't happen to have makes you wonder what step did you miss.\n\nI've only printed a couple of things so far and they have come out well so I can't say much about it.  If I don't update this review assume it is working well otherwise I will write an update.\n\nUpdate:  So far so good.  I've printed out about 30 items with this and posted some in the pictures. This is a great beginner printer IF you are good at DIY stuff.  There are some upgrades to this printrbot that allows you to upgrade from fishing line to a belt system.  I might do that someday but so far the fishing line works (and yes I am still amazed it does).","summary":"A Medieval design but kind of cool.","unixReviewTime":1398470400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_572"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FOOeKjKrL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"10","verified":false,"reviewTime":"01 23, 2016","reviewerID":"A3T8WOFS5RD2IR","asin":"B00HPNFD5C","style":{"Size:":" 1"},"reviewerName":"John D Hillmer","reviewText":"I needed a replacement for my Aprilaire Model 400 Humidifier and this matched the specs that were printed on the OEM one that was on the furnace:\n24/60  2.3 W  125 PSI  Orif 3/64\nIt looks to be made well, came with all the fittings, and had a good stand-off so that it could be mounted on the humidifier in the same location as the original one.

I have printed ABS things that came with it, an ABS bicycle I created with SketchUp, and a wrench using PLA glow-in-the dark filament.  Everything works great.  This is a fantastic machine and technology.  And I had a couple of questions and the legendary Tang answered the first email within an hour on Christmas Eve and the second email within an hour on Christmas morning (Central Standard Time).  Great product, great service and the concept of 3d printing is really cool.\n\nLong Story:  I got interested in 3d printing about a year ago and began shopping and reading web sites.  I noticed that the machines were getting less expensive and per the reviews, more reliable.  In early December I decided it was time to buy one and I suggested to my wife that I was going to do this and it could be my Christmas present.  She said that was fine, but I could not open it until Christmas day.  That was not what I intended but it turned out to be a good thing.  For the 3 weeks or so before Christmas I read everything I could find about how to set up and use this printer.\nThe first thing I discovered is that there is a lot of software involved, and three ways to get objects to the printer.  First, you can download files from the internet.  Second you can create an object then print it, and third you can buy a scanner, scan an object, and then print it.  And you can combine elements of all of those.  You could download a file, merge that with something you scanned, and then import that file into a 3D modeling software like Google SketchUp and modify it.\n\nIm a baby boomer and we all learned things by reading the manual.  Kids today never bothered with manuals so when they started inventing all this stuff they don't bother writing manuals.  You have to figure everything out by reading Customer Reviews and researching on the internet.\nScanning.  I purchased a Matter and Form MFS1v1 3d scanner.  I wrote a review about it, so won't repeat that here.  It works.\nCreate a Model of your own design.  You have to learn to use a software program to do this.  I selected SketchUp because there are good reviews and it is free.  But there are no manuals.  You load it on your PC, then work through 4 training tutorials provided by Google, then you just have to do google searches to try to figure out everything else you need to know to create an object that you can print.\n\nHere is what I learned about SketchUp essential to 3D printing:\n\n1. Build your object in a large size, then let the printing software (more on that later) reduce it in size.  SketchUp was developed as a 3d tool for architecture and lacks the ability to make very tiny parts.  But you can make a big part with high detail then reduce it.\n\n2. Every time you create an object on SketchUp  you must select it then make a group.  Then you right-click and look at Entity Info.  If you see volume you have created a solid that will print on a 3d printer.  If you try to print something that is not a solid the print software will discover manifold problems, and the print won't work.\n\n3. After you create solids, you join them together using a tool called outer shell.  This is the tool on SketchUp 2015.  I think tools on earlier versions had other names.  You get to this tool by: View, Toolbars, Solid Tools.  A bunch of solid objects joined together with Outer Shell result in a model that can be printed.\n\n4. When you first download Sketchup you get the Pro version (for 30 days).  With the pro version you get other Solid Tools and you can output object files.  I got so frustrated that I could not get objects to print properly (just using the print preparation software  see below) that I bought the Pro version.  I now don't think you need it.  The free version will output STL files and the Print Prep software can use either an STL file or and OBJ file\n\n5. When you are finished building your object  export it as on OBJ file or Export it as an STL file.  To export as an STL file you have to add the STL functionality to your SketchUp program.  Again, just Google: Add STL to Sketchup and you will discover how to do this\n\nConvert your File to a Print File:  Next  you prepare your file to print.  This is required regardless of whether you download a model from the internet of use a model you created from SketchUp.  You must have software that is capable of creating a file in the format expected by your printer.  The Print File provides all the info the printer requires heat the extruders, move the print bed, move the extruders, push out the plastic, and so on.\n\nThe directions that come with this printer instruct the user how to download free software and install it  along with other programs and drivers and so on.  I found this baffling and for $140 bought Simplify3D, which is an alternative to the free software.  Simplify3D has about 9 tutorials that explain how to use it.  Remember, Im killing time until Christmas and working through these was very helpful.\n\nWhen you first launch Simplify3D you tell it the brand and model of your printer.  Then, as you import the model you either created or downloaded, the software has preconfigured processes to facilitate printing.  You can change all these but I found the defaults to work great.  When you are ready to print the software shows you an extruder suspended in space above a print bed and it prints your model, on your computer screen.  You can watch it and use the repair menu to find all the problems  before even using the actual printer.  When you have the model printing correctly on your PC, you move the file to the actual printer.\n\nBut this is the cool thing  if you are thinking about buying a 3D printer  get SketchUp and buy Simplify3d.  Make some models; see how they print.  You can learn an awful lot before making the leap to buy the printer.\n\nNow to the FlashForge\n\nIt came, from Amazon, in two days.  It was packed well and everything was in it.\nThe instructions for assembly are clear  but I also found a video of how to assemble a slightly older version that was helpful.\nThis version includes an acrylic cover and front door that help keep the temperature constant which is useful for ABS printing.  The instructions that come with the printer provide a web site with a video that shows how to assemble the acrylic cover that goes on the top of the machine.  Hint:  Take all the protective paper off the acrylic, use some of the painters tape that comes with the printer to tape the acrylic pieces together, install the screws, and remove the tape.  This is a lot easier than the process in the video.\n\nIt took 20 minutes and a lot of patience to get the print bed level.  I finally settled on this procedure  Launch the Level Build Plate on the printer, push the extruder assembly until it is right above the leveling wing-nut closest to you.  Adjust that wing-nut until paper just barely slides; move extruder until it is above the other wing nuts and do the same thing.  You just push it with your hands.  Keep moving the extruder and adjusting the wing nuts until paper just slides, anywhere on the bed.\n\nPrinting was the easiest part.  First, I printed the objects that are on the SD card that comes with the machine.  These printed fine.  I was a little impatient getting the first print off the print bed, which has a layer of Kapton tape. I used a sharp knife from the kitchen to pop the model loose and actually cut into the tape.  So on every subsequent print there is a little flap of Kapton tape sticking up.  Note, however that when you use the Printing Software (in my example Simplify3D), you can check a box for Include Raft.  When you do this, the printer creates a lattice of plastic under your actual object.  That lattice just peels right off when finished.  And the lattice covers up the Kapton tape tear and minor imperfections in levelling.\n\nThen I moved to printing from my PC.  I could not load the driver necessary to connect my PC directly to the printer  but just copied ready-to-print files from Simplify3D to the SDCH card that came with the printer.  Then put the SDCH card in the printer and it works fine.\n\nABS.  First 10 prints were using the ABS filament that came with the printer.  I had studied all the settings and variables available to control the print  but when it came time to do it I just told the Simplify3D software that I was using ABS and wanted a raft and everything came out fine.  NOTE regarding Supports.  The reason I bought a two extruder printer was because I thought you needed a second extruder to generate supports for parts with a big overhang, using one of those soluble plastics that can later be dissolved.  It turns out that the Simplify3D software (and probably most others) can print supports just using the same ABS spool as your model.  Somehow the supports are printed so they don't stick very much and they just break off.  The only time you would really need soluble supports is if they had to be printed inside your model where you could not easily remove them.\n\nPLA.  Same story (almost).  I backed out the ABS filament and loaded some PLA (that actually glows in the dark!).  Everything had been printing so smoothly on the Kapton tape that I just told Simplify3D I was using PLA  and printed! I did not bother to use the Painters Tape as instructed because that would require re-leveling the print bed.  The PLA print on the Kapton tape worked fine for about 10 minutes then the entire RAFT pulled loose and got caught against the extruder and I was not watching closely and a LOT of PLA got gummed up on the end of the extruder.  Cleaned it up, installed a couple strips of painters tape, re-leveled and it prints fine.  LESSON:  follow the instructions.\n\nThis machine and all the software are really fun.  About the equivalent to a two hour college course, I think.  I highly recommend this machine and the company that backs it up.","summary":"Excellent Machine","unixReviewTime":1419552000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_585"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lJ9svEaSL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"07 31, 2017","reviewerID":"A7RVPNXDB16SW","asin":"B00IB0ZJXE","reviewerName":"Madds Dad","reviewText":"Excellent wall timer, reasonably priced, and excellent customer service as well!

A specialist accessory received for evaluation and review.  There are a whole range of uses for this versatile tool, but in a nutshell, it allows a thorough investigation of small, dark, hidden, out-of-range spaces.  The idea is the same as the medical version, a long flexible tube with a camera head (8.5 mm in this case) and some strong LED lights to illuminate the way at one end and a standard USB connector at the other.  The camera resolution offers a very useful quality range: up to 600 x 1200 pixels, and the images we get are really sharp, especially after a little experimentation.  The ability to regulate the light intensity is a definite asset.  This unit is waterproof and appears to be very tough and fit for the its intended applications;  some examples: investigating the state of a location out of reach of fingers and eyesight; locating an obstruction inside a tube or conduit (even full of water); verifying the condition of the back of appliances that cannot be moved; car repairs.  It's the sort of thing that, once you own it, you will find many uses for, that are not immediately apparent.\n\nWe initially tested it by photographing the inside of a Hummingbird electrified guitar.  The output jack had worked loose once again (it had already been sent back for professional remedial action once).  Due to the very limited space inside the guitar body, just enough for a slim hand, it was essential to know the exact situation.  We had already spent a lot of frustrating time trying to screw the piece back on.  Once the Endoscope head had been put into position, we were able to view the whole area and identify both the problem and the solution.  We fixed the guitar in under one minute.\n\nIn the box are the endoscope itself, some small tools that attach to the camera head (a hook, mirror and magnet), software installation CD, and a manual (also on the CD). The software loaded without problems on a laptop running Win 8.1.  Manoeuvring the photo head was easy enough (it would be even easier inside a tube), taking still photos and especially video were intuitive and successful.  The other option is to simply view the camera's progress on the screen, but recording the images may be useful.  I was quite blown away by the quality of the images, and the performance of this brilliant diagnostic tool.

I purchased it directly from the manufacturer before most people were able to buy it here. This printer is fantastic. The print quality is better than a MakerBot Replicator 2 or 2X (both of which I also use).\n\nI like the fact that the filament is located inside the printer. This helps keep dust off the filament providing a cleaner print. This is quite important as dust and other foreign objects like bits of hair, etc., can build up in the extruder over time, and can lead to clogged nozzles.\n\nThe way this printer handles prints sent over USB is different than a lot of other printers. This printer allows you to disconnect the USB cable immediately after sending the print job to the printer. Once the printer has the print job loaded the printer then prints the object on its own, no USB connection is needed while it prints. The MakerBot Replicator 2 and 2X cannot do this over USB. They must be connected throughout the entire print job when using USB to print. It can also print over WIFI. Which is great if your printer is not near your computer.\n\nI love the fact that the build platform is very sturdy. The MakerBot Replicator 2 and 2X have a plastic based build platform which bends and deforms, and even tilts a bit while you print your object. They often requiring re-leveling after many prints. Their plastic build platform arms are also known to break. The build platform on the Dreamer has arms made of aluminum, not plastic. It feels very solid, and doesn't bend or deform. I only leveled my printer 1 time, and it's been working perfectly since. The only time I would ever need to re-level it is if I installed print nozzles of a different size, or if I changed the print surface to a different material (i.e., changing from blue painter's tape to glass, or PET tape). It never goes out of alignment on its own.\n\nAnother thing I love about this printer is that every filament type I have tried on it works great. The MakerBot Replicator 2X can't print normal PLA without jamming because it uses an old out dated print head. The MakerBot Replicator 2 can't print ABS and similar materials without it warping because it doesn't have a heated build plate. This printer handles everything, ABS, PLA, you name it. It can do it all and do it very well. I have printed ABS, PLA, HIPS, PETT, PETG, and exotic filaments such as CopperFill, Zen Toolworks Wood, and even flexible filament such as NinjaFlex, and ASAPTech TPE. The flexible filament required a modified print drive block I made which is found here for free (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:431115). Apparently the newer Dreamer printers don't need this modification. FlashForge keeps improving the design. Note that printing CopperFill will wear out the print head after a while. Be prepared to have a second set of PTFE tubes and nozzles if you're going to be printing anything with metal in it like CopperFill.\n\nThe touch screen is great. I can't stand the cheap rubber buttons on the MakerBots. They are hard to press, and I feel like I'm going to break them, and I'm never really sure if I've pressed them properly or not. The touch screen on the Dreamer is so much nicer. It's bright and easy to read at angles. I get very clear visual feedback when I touch the screen.\n\nThe FlashPrint software is about the same as MakerBot's MakerWare. There are some minor differences. Both produce about the same quality slicing because they use the same slicing engines (Skeinforge and Slic3r). The software is very decent. And all you really need. But I do like to use Simplify3D most of the time. Simplify3D is far superior in terms of printing options. Simplify3D works directly over USB with the MakerBots but doesn't work directly over USB with the Dreamer (but does work with the FlashForge Creator directly over USB). Simplify3D can however be made to create G-code that's compatible with the Dreamer if you create your own custom profile for it, like I did (you need to modify the start G-code, and make a few other changes to get it working).\n\nI am very happy with the prints it produces. It doesn't require nearly as much maintenance as a MakeBot Replicator 2 or 2X. The Dreamer is definitely made better. The Dreamer belts even have tension springs on them to help keep the proper belt tension. This is not found on the MakerBots. On them, you need to manually adjust the spacing to tighten or loosen the belts. Also on the Dreamer, the filament never jams on the rolls, a problem I had a lot on the MakerBots (the filament tends to unravel off the rolls and get twisted around the spool holder and get stuck). The filament guide tubes also never come off like they do on the MakerBots. It's just all-in-all a much more well thought out machine. FlashForge did a great job on this printer.\n\nI have printed hundreds of things so far. In the entire year of use I've only experienced 1 major filament jam. With the MakerBot Replicator 2 and 2X I've had dozens of jams.\n\nI have recently started comparing prints at 0.10 mm and 30 mm/s between the Dreamer and the MakerBot Replicator 2 and 2X I also use. The quality of the Dreamer at 0.10 mm is much better than the MakerBots. There's far less rough areas. The prints are a lot cleaner. At lower resolutions, the three printers are comparable, with the Dreamer only printing slightly better. But at 0.10 mm, the Dreamer really out performs the other 2. Of the three, the worst is the MakerBot Replicator 2X, which isn't surprising because of the older head it has. For the tests for all machines I'm using the Simplify3D slicer with nearly identical settings. So software slicer differences don't account for the Dreamer having better quality prints at 0.10mm.\n\nOne negative I've noticed when comparing to the MakerBots. The Dreamer is louder than the MakerBots are when they are printing. Even when you aren't printing, the fan for the CPU can be heard when it's on. The MakerBots don't have a CPU fan. They make no noise when they are on if they aren't printing.\n\nIn comparison to the MakerBot Replicator 2X, the Dreamer doesn't appear to have nearly as much edge curling problems when printing ABS. This has always been a problem when printing large ABS objects on the 2X. I have printed objects that take the entire build area of the Dreamer and saw very little detectable edge curling and no cracking. On the 2X, large ABS prints always have a lot of edge curling, and an occasional thin crack on them.\n\nI believe the main reason for a lack of curling when printing ABS on the Dreamer is the aluminum build platform (which is covered with some black coating making it look like plastic, but it's actually aluminum). Aluminum conducts heat very well, ensuring a very evenly heated build surface. On the MakerBot 2X, I've noticed that the center of the build platform is hotter than the outer regions. This isn't the case with the Dreamer. The heat is very even across the entire build platform.\n\nAfter so many prints and ordering new filament, I've found that the main negative about the dreamer is also a positive: THE FILAMENT HOLDER IS INSIDE THE DREAMER. This is great on one hand because it keeps the filament away from dust, and makes it feed flawlessly. But because commercially available filament varies so much in spool shape and size, it's tough to get filament from different companies that fits inside the dreamer properly. I didn't see this as such a big problem at first until I started ordering a lot of filament from different companies which work fine on the external MakerBot's filament holder, but won't fit inside the Dreamer's internal filament holder. I'm going to need to print an external spool holder for the Dreamer so that I can use filament of any size for my Dreamer. Being limited to certain sizes SUCKS. But it's not the Dreamer's fault that there's no standard filament size yet. Some filament also doesn't fit the MakerBot's filament holder (such as Shaxon brand filament which doesn't fit the MakerBots or the Dreamer). The lack of a standard filament roll size is a serious problem that the industry needs to address.\n\nI have made a few free printable filament spool stand which allows me to use pretty much any brand of filament with the Flashforge Dreamer.\n\nMy free printable OmniStand Adjustable Filament Spool Stand for inside the Dreamer is found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:652415\n\nMy free printable OmniStand Top Mount Filament Spool Stand is found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:704631","summary":"Great high quality low priced printer.","unixReviewTime":1405468800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_666"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/416-F-Lg+mL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Mx903GnLL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZozBNqJ9L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/416-F-Lg+mL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41eiB6+7AoL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUc30jY3L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51rbajSsStL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41v0xgQXwqL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Yq+2xjmWL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41L-mqXuD6L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/411JCV3bNPL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KpkqamyML._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XXQ+2XJvL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41mcuZfmR7L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41styqMAULL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KpkqamyML._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/416-F-Lg+mL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Mx903GnLL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/416-F-Lg+mL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUc30jY3L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41v0xgQXwqL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41L-mqXuD6L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KpkqamyML._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"16","verified":true,"reviewTime":"06 25, 2016","reviewerID":"A36TXJVACY60VF","asin":"B00JRBQJ6W","reviewerName":"Salrous","reviewText":"I am a proud owner of flashforge Creator Pro, Flashforge Finder and now Dreamer first let me talk about Flashforger support and company, no ,matter what is your problem and how long you own your printer flashforger support always there to support and help you solve your problem that's why I have all the 3 printers by them and any new printer release they will have I will own too, thank you Mr. Tang.\nall printers has issues and will have issues from nozzle jam to extruder movement issues, and be sure that flashforge team is there with you.\nnow my review for the printer, I gave it 4 star rating and 1 star extra for flashforge support lets get to the pros and cons\nPros:\n1. sizable build volume with the price you pay.\n2. 100 micron and can really go to 75 micron at slower speed no problem I tried it, and give good quality resolution\n3. Flashprint software that come with it is great slicer, I my self love Simplify3d but the flashforge print is no less.\n4. low price for a good quality printer good looking and ability to use all types of filaments to your heart contents.\n5. active cooling system and heated bed and wireless connection, SD card print and USB port printing, easy to use menu.\n6. bed leveling is easy, not automatic but as easy as it gets for such printers.\n7. Dual extruder, although I find the use of dual extruder limited, but its an option, and this printer do it very will, other dula extruder printers you would pay double the price and many failed at it.\nCons:\n1. spool size and location inside the printer, it the worse feature of it but you can always overcome it by printing upgrades like I did or use external spool holder, flashforge filament is not bad at all but lacks the colors I like and there is much better quality of filaments if you have the money for it, also printing with exotic filaments such as laywood, laybrick, brass, copper, ...etc they have spool sizes that won't go to your printer, but the problem is solved if you have the patient and don't mind to print from outside\n2. the plastic frame of the printer, I really not a fan of this plastic frame, creator pro and finder has a better quality frame, although this printer look good but come on the frame makes it cheap and I am always worried it melt from the heat although I know its unlikely.\n3. the touch screen has an SD inside the printer some times it move out of place when it shipped, this happened to me and it renders the printer touch screen to be white and not work, I had to open the bottom cover and fix it, and now it work great but its not fun to open a new item you just bought to fix it, I wish this issue be solved in future versions of this printer.\n\nhere is links to spool upgrades that I love and helped me use 3rd party filaments:\n1. [...] my favorite which I am currently using and its working great\n2. [...] another great for PLA or ABS external spool holder my second best\n3. [...] just a spool holder which is good really good holder idea\n\nI hope my review helps and please comment for questions\n Update 7/30/2016\nthis printer proven its worth, I have 5 printers and yet this one never gave me a clog or a problem its running like a charm attached pictures of my printers.\nUltimaker 2+ is $2500 running at same if not less as Flashforge dreamer.\nI love this printer its good, look at the dual extruder quality!","summary":"$1099 for great printer is a win, no regrets!","unixReviewTime":1466812800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_667"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jUrpZpXJL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"02 29, 2016","reviewerID":"A1QWXEQWTHZBQW","asin":"B00JRBQJ6W","reviewerName":"Danny mendiola","reviewText":"Wow!!!

First off I have to say that the Flashforage dreamer is a high quality and reliable 3d printer. There is a large learning curve when you first get this printer, you will need to play with the bed leveling and slicing settings. Once you figure this out the prints that you make are highly likely to succeed. The printer also is able to print with many different materials because of the All metal hotend. I have successfully printed with Nylon, PLA, ABS, TPU, Metal, and PETG without a single clog.\n\nDon't get me wrong my experience with this printer was not without problems. When I first used the printer I found that I was not able to use the wifi connection or update the firmware of the printer, also the PLA cooling fan was not working. But all of these problems were fixed tough contact trough the excellent Flashforage customer support. Mr Tang the Flashforage Amazon support representative quickly responded to the problems that I had. Through Mr Tang I was able to get a fan replacement for no charge. If you experience any problems, I will highly recommend contacting Mr Tang for assistance.\n\nThe high quality printer with Mr Tang's support makes this printer a very good deal. The price of the Flashforge Dreamer may be slightly expensive, but you get what you pay for. In the end if you want a reliable reliable 3d printer for a reasonable price then the Flashforge Dreamer is for you.","summary":"High quality and reliable printer once you get past the learning curve","unixReviewTime":1454371200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_669"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61A6E4RBIxL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71b0TqEJgCL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MSujT2S8L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HjAkPec1L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712n1BDOuiL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"25","verified":true,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2015","reviewerID":"A31MSBZDI6RBH4","asin":"B00JRBQJ6W","reviewerName":"VU Engineer","reviewText":"This is one of my favorite printers to use on a regular basis, and the quality is great for the money.\n\nPros:\n1. Really nice to have an extruder fan and case fans on a dual extruder printer. This is incredibly important if you're trying to print PLA or Ninjaflex.\n2. The touch interface is much easier to use and more aesthetically pleasing compared to many of the button-style menus other printers use.\n3. Overall the printer is fairly compact.\n4. It is able to print flexible filaments from the factory, no upgraded extrusion block necessary.\n5. Not sure why, but programs seem to post/save quicker on the SD card for this printer from Simplify3D than it does on my other printers.\n6. Printer seems to be stackable, but I haven't tried it myself.\n7. After ~1000 hours of printing I had one extruder fan go out, and the customer support actually responded in only a couple hours, AND they sent me a new one the same day free of charge. With so many printer companies now charging for any type of support (looking at you Makerbot) this is a breath of fresh air.\n\nCons:\n1. The power supply is cooled by a fan so it's louder than many of the other printers in standby. While printing it's comparable in noise.\n2. The internal spool holders work well for Flashforge's filament, but not well with other 'standard' filament spools. I ended up printing my own spool holders that replace the 'windows' on the sides.

Make sure you do your RESEARCH if you've never worked with a 3D printer before so you know what to expect as this thing is not a toy! Many things can go wrong its not even funny...So expect issues because 3D printing is not perfect even if you buy a makerbot (aka the Apple of 3D printers -_-)\n\nSETUP:\nThe printer comes mostly assembled, just requires some plug n' play. The most time consuming part of the setup is leveling the bed. Definitely take your time doing this and keep the Z-axis pin stop very high at first. Sparkfun has a nice setup video that is very helpful. Was not a fan of Prontoface host software so I used Repetier (does the same thing). Overall I was up and running in about an hour or two.\n\nDETAILS:\nMake sure to use the Slic3r config files that Lulzbot provides, then you can tweak those to your satisfaction. This printer is very fast! and quieter than the airwolf. I love how the bed is held down, very little do the clips holding the glass stick out onto the glass. The Airwolf and many other printers use those black binder clips to hold the glass down -_-\n\nThe extruder can heat up to 240C which is more than enough for ABS (which needs 230). Follow the temperature guides from Lulzbot and the filament manufac. The bed actually is a lot hotter than what the controller says it is, so for ABS keep it at 85C and not 110! you can damage it.\n\nAnother great thing is that I rarely have to interfere during the print process. On the Airwolf I would always have to pull off excess filament that oozes out or it may mess up the first few layers. This is rarely the case with this printer. In terms of the spool holder, it is very universal so I would say pretty much all filaments can fit on there. The Airwolf had a larger spool holder that didn't work with half of the spools out there. The feeding tube is also very useful for keeping the filament from tangling which can ruin both you print and printer.\n\nThe LCD control is pretty much the same as what the Airwolf and other printers uses. The knob that allows you to cycle through the menus requires you to turn it a few clicks before it registers but you get used to it. I don't like to leave my computer on so I used the SD card feature pretty much ever time.\n\nI only use IC3D filament for ABS, the filament that Lulzot sells is honestly too expensive (plus shipping). The PLA I use is from MATTERHAKERS. Both companies have some of the best filament you can get.\n\nSUPPORT:\nThis is crucial for me because I don't want to be stuck with $2,000+ machine with no support for WHEN things go wrong. Lulzbot has amazing support, i've already spammed their emails multiple times and they've responded within 24 hours with a fix. The forums have a lot of helpful posts as well, so use and abuse it to your advantage.\n\nEDIT 09-2014: One of the motors (extruder) stopped working, Brent from support helped me troubleshoot the issue which ended up being the controller (RAMBo). I was slightly out of warranty but they were awesome and swapped out my entire electronics box ($200+).\n\nHighly recommend this printer over many in it's class. Its cheaper, easier to setup and just has so much more to offer.\n\nIM3D.org","summary":"Pure Awesomeness","unixReviewTime":1404086400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_671"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81HoPi0XIlL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"7","verified":true,"reviewTime":"04 24, 2016","reviewerID":"A3L435IGOVFCA7","asin":"B00K2QZZM0","style":{"Color:":" Red","Length:":" 5","Number of Items:":" 1","Overall Length:":" 5"},"reviewerName":"natahoa","reviewText":"VERY good.

It is accurate, easy to use, and provides temperature information in seconds. The unit is lightweight yet seems very well constructed and durable. If you are looking for a baking thermometer of this style, then I recommend it to you.\n\nUpon receiving this thermometer, I read the package materials thoroughly to gain an understanding on how to use it. The instructions on the back are clearly written and easy to understand, though my one wish is that the text was written in black ink instead of in white ink (black ink would provide better contrast against the package's gray background). Still, the content of the instructions is perfectly fine.\n\nThe thermometer came with one CR2032 battery installed, so all we had to do was push the power button and begin to use it. Right out of the box this thermometer was on the mark. We tested it with ice water, boiling water, body temperature and the ambient room temperature in our house... and this thing was dead on every time. Nice to see quality gear still available out there!\n\nThere are several features that really add value to this thermometer: It responds quickly - the advertised 6 second read time is no joke, it really was at least that fast every time; The IPX7 (water resistant) rating is very nice so we will worry less when washing it off after each use (but still would not place in the dishwasher); The range is amazing (-52 to 572 degrees F) and the ability to calibrate the temperature is great, should the need ever arise; and the 10 minute auto shutdown feature will probably save us purchasing a few extra CR2032 batteries over time.\n\nThe look and feel of this unit is very nice. If you would like to see pictures I took of the thermometer, please navigate to the unit's main sales page, scroll down to where the \"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\" section starts, and look to the right of that area for the \"Product Images From Customers\" section.\n\nThere was no reference to a warranty on the Amazon sales listing page, and the package provides and email address to contact for warranty questions. While I did not contact Measupro via that email address, if an issue arises I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this thermometer gratis from the manufacturer and have put it through its paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.\n\nIf you are looking for baking thermometer of this size and style, for use as I have described above, based on our experience I would recommend this one wholeheartedly.

A specialist accessory received for evaluation and review.  There are a whole range of uses for this versatile tool, but in a nutshell, it allows a thorough investigation of small, dark, hidden, out-of-range spaces.  The idea is the same as the medical version, a long flexible tube with a camera head (8.5 mm in this case) and some strong LED lights to illuminate the way at one end and a standard USB connector at the other.  The camera resolution offers a very useful quality range: up to 600 x 1200 pixels, and the images we get are really sharp, especially after a little experimentation.  The ability to regulate the light intensity is a definite asset.  This unit is waterproof and appears to be very tough and fit for the its intended applications;  some examples: investigating the state of a location out of reach of fingers and eyesight; locating an obstruction inside a tube or conduit (even full of water); verifying the condition of the back of appliances that cannot be moved; car repairs.  It's the sort of thing that, once you own it, you will find many uses for, that are not immediately apparent.\n\nWe initially tested it by photographing the inside of a Hummingbird electrified guitar.  The output jack had worked loose once again (it had already been sent back for professional remedial action once).  Due to the very limited space inside the guitar body, just enough for a slim hand, it was essential to know the exact situation.  We had already spent a lot of frustrating time trying to screw the piece back on.  Once the Endoscope head had been put into position, we were able to view the whole area and identify both the problem and the solution.  We fixed the guitar in under one minute.\n\nIn the box are the endoscope itself, some small tools that attach to the camera head (a hook, mirror and magnet), software installation CD, and a manual (also on the CD). The software loaded without problems on a laptop running Win 8.1.  Manoeuvring the photo head was easy enough (it would be even easier inside a tube), taking still photos and especially video were intuitive and successful.  The other option is to simply view the camera's progress on the screen, but recording the images may be useful.  I was quite blown away by the quality of the images, and the performance of this brilliant diagnostic tool.  I'll be making a video as soon as I have a moment, but for now I'll just post some photos and a screenshot taken from video footage.","summary":"Brilliant diagnostic tool for those small, dark places","unixReviewTime":1453420800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_680"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jvVtGVsiL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":3,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"12 8, 2015","reviewerID":"A81D82ZIC4DEM","asin":"B00KMPJ8DS","reviewerName":"Roger L.","reviewText":"This is a really neat little gizmo!

As a structural material, there are some drawbacks. The feeling, and my guess equivalent strength, is balsa wood. Very light material, but not as strong for compressive forces as regular PLA. It also doesn't have a lot of layer strength, so I'd suggest using more infill than you would normal. For example, the barrels you can see in the pic have been printed in both grey PLA and this wood filament, with the exact same settings (10% Infill, .1mm layers). The PLA filament is surprisingly strong. I'm not certain at this size that I could break them with my bare hands, while with the wood filament I broken one in half just touching it on the print bed (wasn't even trying to take it off yet).\n\nBut that's not why I bought it. I wanted to simulate wooden objects at small scale for D&D, and for that it works incredible well. I've very happy with the results. I tore out some of the infill from the broken barrel to use as straw packing material in the crates and it looks pretty realistic. I've sanded them a little, and that seems to work okay, though I haven't tried it extensively yet. The resulting models are noticeably lighter than with PLA. Overall it is pretty easy to work with, and adhered to the bed well (heated glass bed, 80C, 205C for the extruder, and using washable glue sticks).","summary":"Useful material, but be mindful of the weaknesses","unixReviewTime":1460851200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_683"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wq5DoreQL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"9","verified":true,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2016","reviewerID":"A2EU9A4C77PAPO","asin":"B00L1S93PS","style":{"Size:":" 1 Count"},"reviewerName":"amazon_princess","reviewText":"Every AmScope product we've bought has been a winner in the value department.\n\nYears ago we got the kids (ok, really a gift for myself) an Amscope \"Compound Biological Microscope\", and I was impressed with the quality of the construction and optics for the price.

Amazon lists me as being a customer \"only\" since 2000, but I used them before that for work/personal items.\n\nTHE SHORT REVIEW:\n\nI plugged it into the wall AC after checking that it was set to 110 AC. This units specs are up to 30V / 5A.\n\nI turned on the power switch and immediately the fan kicked in and the Voltage shot to 50.2V and the current went to 6.65A and the knobs had no effect of any kind.\n\nI snapped a photo and typed a quick note to the seller (By4Easy) about the problem. The CV light was also on. The low switch only changed the current down to 3.3 amps.\n\nA few seconds after sending the email I heard a large BANG and something blew up inside the unit.\n\nThis power source lasted less than 3 minutes.\n\nAfter multiple emails over a couple weeks, and driving around town a bit I received a FULL refund.\n\nTHE LONGER REVIEW IF YOU'RE INTERESTED:\n\nYoure supposed to use the supplied leads to short out the unit and make adjustments to the current / voltage but it was at 50v 6a and I was a little leery about that. I hesitated, but again, the unit was on for less than 3 minutes (more about that down below).\n\nI emailed again and asked for a refund saying the unit blew up and won't turn, they asked for a photo of the problem.\n\nI sent them the photo of the readouts at the super high levels (glad I wasted a few seconds taking the photo, or else Id have had to send just a photo of the unit turned off/dead).\n\nThey emailed back and said theyd send me a shipping label. It was a self ship. I paid $35 + $15 for this unit. The shipping from the Post Office was $39 BEFORE any insurance. The UPS store was just a little less, but still more than the unit cost me. That in itself shows that if you get a working version of this item it really is a DAMN GOOD DEAL! If\n\nSo, I wasted a day driving around to shipping companies, having them way this thing and measure the box and then quote some outrageous price. None of their weights, measurements seemed to match each other, but every single one wanted about $40 to ship this thing back home.\n\nHaving never returned anything in my past 18 years on Amazon I thought that was the end of it and itd just pull some of the heavy and nice seeming parts off this thing, but someone told me to re-email the seller. I did and a day later they emailed a new shipping label that was pre-paid. Cool!\n\nThey received (and signed) for the package after a few days. About a week later I emailed and asked about the refund. They emailed back and said theyd issue me a refund. Um, okay. Obviously they got the item back but did nothing about it. The next day I got a refund notice from Amazon and a few days after that the refund appeared on my credit card.\n\nI am a librarian. Ive been using Amazon since 1998, back when they only sold books and magazine subscriptions. This is the FIRST ITEM IN 20 years Ive tried to return. I think this is only my SECOND 1 star rating since 1998. You can go see some of the items Ive reviewed/rated beforeI research and am generally very, very happy with my purchases. If the product is what is was supposed to be they get a 5 star, if  kinda sucks or I hate it for personal reasons it's a 4. I'm an easy grader, even though this review will sound run-of-the-mill whiney to many, that's not my style.\n\nI knew this purchase would be a gamble because of all the reviews saying the power cords arrive with short circuits in them. I figured if that was the case I could just use a spare computer cord and throw away the one that comes with the unit. I would have rated it 5 stars if that were the case, but this just went to a deadly 6.6 amps (albeit, the promised 5 amps would be just as deadly I suppose-but not deadly to the actual unit).\n\nThe instructions say: turn on unit, THEN short out the terminals and quickly make adjustments. The supplied banana plug fell off the wire lead upon opening the package. Even if this thing didn't blow up I don't feel good about attaching (AS AN INTENTIONAL SHORT) cheap, thin wires to a RUNNING power supply blasting out 50v 6.6a. Yeah, I know people say that even cheap leads are good up to 10amps, but Im thinking: these people cant build a power supply, they cant attach the banana plug to a lead so it stays attached in shipping, Im going to trust my life/fingers to them? Anyway, there wasn't time: the thing just blew up sitting on the shelf with nobody touching it, thankfully. I supposed an experienced electrician would have immediately leaped across the table, shut it down and diagnosed the problem while disassembling it and simultaneously drinking a cup of coffee and doing a crossword puzzle. Um, yeah. Maybe. But with 50 volts at over 6.5 amps they/ I / we shouldnt have to and I'm more of a Lissajous Figure/Oscilloscope mellow type of guy. New to the higher voltages, lol.\n\nIve watched YouTube videos of people unboxing and using this SAME MODEL unit and they plug it in and it doesnt go past zero (let alone 50v) and explode. They plug it in, marvel at the cool red digital readout and then go on to whatever project their doing. Many owners weren't sure if the unit had a fan in it, yet my fan screamed on start up louder than my Dell desktop running Vista. Mine was special.\n\nAfter unplugging the now dead brick I noticed 3 of the 4 screws holding the transformer to the bottom of the unit were loose. These are the screws sticking out of the bottom of the unit: I did NOT open the unit up. Did the transformer shift and short out something inside? I didn't want to peak inside since I was going to return this defective unit. I did notice the paint was flaking off the case near the almost all the screws that hold the case on. Had someone been playing inside this unit before or was it just a lousy paint job?\n\nI knew that and gambled it would be a simple power switch, AC cable, AC to unit interface joint problem that people other were experiencing and then fixing. A fun, cheap way to get a power supply that you kind of fixed/modified yourself. Or heck, maybe Id be in the chosen few and get a unit that actually WORKED like promised.\n\nNope: I guess I got the NEW AND IMPROVED version that is shorted and runs at twice spec for a minute or two then explodes. It was LITERALLY less than three minutes by the time stamps on my photos and emails. Bummer, but for what I paid theres some nice parts I could have scavenged in the worst case scenario.\n\nI noticed the instruction manual covers a bunch of different versions of this unit, including ones that go up to 60v. Maybe some 60v parts snuck into my unit-not enough to keep it from exploding thoughthat awful snap of an electrolytic capacitor (Im guessing) going off like a firecracker.\n\nHonestly, 17 years on Amazon and there was a batch of cheap camera lens covers that fell off because they weren't true Canon size (which I gave a 3 star review); a bipod that arrived missing one of the two mounting pins that were supposed to be WELDED on (which I gave a 1 star review and repaired myself kinda sorta; and then THIS hunk of electric danger. [Edit: I have now made a SECOND return in 17 years on Amazon, because I was shipped a Counterfeit item-confirmed by manufacturer when I tried to register it-but that was not from this seller].\n\nThats about it for bad experiences in 17 years of buying for myself (tons of weird gadgets like spectroscopes, fancy telescope and camera stuff) and for libraries (books and office supplies). I wasn't even going to buy it and deleted it off my wish list, but I recently had an incredible run of some big, expensive and boring life purchases (mattress, car repair parts, medical bills, etc.) and wanted something fun.\n\nOh, you can see through the vent holes the less than stellar soldering job the boys in the FlingDung factory did. Its not horrible (what I can see) but you can definitely tell a human did the soldering and not a machinein a not so great way. To be sure, if you look inside the Elenco kit power supply that *I* soldered together a couple weeks ago youd probably laugh at a few things as well, but then again, you don't HAVE to look inside mine because mine WORKS.\n\nAlso, Ive only soldered 5 kits in the past few years and Id say the best of their soldering is better than the best of mine, but the worst of their soldering is way worse than the worst of mine. But then: I do not get paid to solder things and again, MINE WORKS! This does not.\n\nMy self-soldered capacitance decade box works fine! Along with the Geiger Counter in a coffee can (it raises the voltage when my ionizing uranium/uraninite test source is near, but does nothing with other rocks in my mineral collection and tallies pretty well with my real store-bought Geiger counter).\n\nAre you looking for cheap parts or a possible mystery problem to figure out? Well, this unit is for you. Its very, very heavy and looks really cool. The digital meters wold look kinda cool hooked up to another (working) power supply if you want this thing for parts. There are course and fine adjustment knobs, which if ordered by themselves would probably cost as much as this unit.\n\nThe banana plug leads seem nickel coated, which is why the factory workers were unable to successfully solder the banana plugs and alligator clips to each end. DANGEROUS because theyll pull out and youll have a live wire dangling somewhereif your unit actually works. If\n\nI opened the bag with the wire leads and a banana plug just fell out on its own. Ugh!\n\nMAKE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE KOOKY PHOTO I POSTED HERE (sometimes the Amazon phone/tablet apps don't show customer photos so you may have to use the browser version or a desktop computer). It shows 50V / 6.5 Amps. They were both a tad higher, but remember, a few seconds after snapping the photo something inside this thing literally exploded.\n\nI suppose I could be angry/upset/indignant/etc. but I just chuckled. Also: THE SELLERS WERE REALLY POLITE in their various emails to me, and DID get me a FULL refund. However, this product is obviously junk and they really shouldnt be selling it until they fix the multitude of manufacturing problems they're continuously encountering in their factory for the past few years ago to some of the other reviews here.\n\nSave yourself trouble and look elsewhere. Never buy anything that isn't PRIME / shipped by Amazon themselves / Fulfilled by Amazon if it was worth returning upon receipt of a defective unit. I lucked out and (after multiple prodding emails along the way) got a successful refund of ALL my money on this item.\n\nIve soldering up my own working power supply that is still working just fine. All I did was plug this unit in and it blew up. This was my first ever Amazon return in 17 years. I am jealous of people who just had faulty power cords, etc. that were easy fixes.\n\n-Mike from Detroit","summary":"SELLER IS AWESOME - BUT THE UNIT IS NOT","unixReviewTime":1442707200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_685"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Q0nAq2saL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YpCC-rJ+L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"5","verified":false,"reviewTime":"03 28, 2015","reviewerID":"A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ","asin":"B00LCZ9FH6","reviewerName":"PhotoGraphics","reviewText":"Up to this point every similar model of battery operated under cabinet light has shared the same negatives  they are cheap plastic, they look ugly, they need to be screwed down or attached with hard-to-use clip mounts, they throw uneven light and they are expensive.\n\nThe Bliss model is the best, hands down, I have seen so far. It looks and feels substantial, being primarily brushed aluminum. It is much smaller than competitive models and will win as best looking every time. The mounting system is genius  press it in place and the super-strong tape holds it there. Want to remove it as a portable light or to change the batteries? Simply grab and go, it is held in place by strong magnets. The lighting pattern is wide and smooth with an even falloff at the edges and this is one of the lowest price LED under-counter lights I have seen (except for a few that were really junk).\n\nBliss makes the identical light in two models. Ive included photos showing them side-by-side (they are identical looking). But when they are turned on there is a (excuse the expression) night and day difference. The warm white that this review is about looks like the illumination in a typical home. It is a soft color of lighting that you hardly notice. I am using mine under a cabinet in my kitchen which has halogen track lighting and the light from the Bliss blends right in. I love that it turns on only when human hands move under the counter and then turns off about a minute later. Why turn an entire track-light of halogen ceiling lights on just to go pour a drink at the counter?\n\nI also included a photo that shows the twin model that produces a cool light color. This color is more in line with daylight and works better in the shop, office or outdoors.\n\nIMPORTANT: this is something you will want to know when choosing between the two models. The warm while light is MUCH brighter than the cool white, like about 10 times brighter. There are times you may want that brightness and other times where you would prefer a more subtle light. I have the cool white mounted subtly under a counter lip in the guest bathroom so it illuminates the toilet bowl. It throws just enough light without glaring and being a nuisance for the guest. I have also mounted one in a cabinet where we have a printer installed  the status screen and buttons are on the top of the printer and almost impossible to see.

A very high quality piece of workmanship, this nozzle looks like it will last for a very long time.","summary":"Works Great!","unixReviewTime":1476316800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_690"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615r9EBs55L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yE7ewRH9L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"4","verified":true,"reviewTime":"06 26, 2016","reviewerID":"A2O96ZTLTIMG8S","asin":"B00LK51PDK","reviewerName":"Hot Cold Warm","reviewText":"**7/8/2016 update- a few more projects were completed...\nThe Sonicrafter has completed each task quickly, easily and because of that great help the noise level doesn't bother me any longer. The Rockwell 4.0A Sonicrafter has earned its 5 stars for being all around effective tool making life easier and worthy of recommending to others.\n\nThe sander works great sanding down unpainted wood (pallet wood that was being re-purposed for outdoor stuff)- I had no issues with the pad slipping off (it is velcro adhesion- just place it on the sanding pad,light press, and sand). It smoothed out the general unfinished surface of rough saw cut wood, leveled off the uneven cut marks, and removed splintering wood.\n\nIt was great for resurfacing by sanding away the weathered gray black discolored wood down to the \"fresh\" brighter wood surface in preparation for staining. For some reason I did not think it would because it looked so small, so yes, I was impressed that this small triangular sanding head can really get a lot done.\n\nThe photo shows the heavy duty metal hinge the Sonicrafter easily cut through when I replaced the hinges that rusted off an old custom sized screen door. The metal semi circle saw did the job quickly without issues or heating up. It was a simple task to make it fit without having to undo the screen and trim I had just replaced.\n\n--------------\nI am happy with my purchase so far it seems to be fine serving its purpose thus I feel I got a good value.\nHowever I must point out something that I was not prepared for when I purchased this: I had no idea about the ear drum blowing volume of the Rockwell 4.0A Sonicrafter F50 with the sawing blade when working and doing its thing.\n\nIt is screaming LOUD, so loud that it's almost ridiculous that such a level of noise is coming from this small tool and small blade.\nI will harp on a bit longer about how loud the Sonicrafter F50 is because I was shocked when I used it. It is so loud that, seriously, all of the neighbors on my block will know when I am using this tool each and every time.\nTo compare the sound level, circular saws are loud but it is a bigger tool bigger saw blade etc, but the Sonicrafter F50 is about as loud but with a screeching higher pitch.\n\nSince this is my first oscillating multi-tool, I do not know if perhaps most oscillating multi-tools are the same way concerning the volume. I think that it is just the way this tool works not that there is anything wrong with it.\n\nAside from the noise, YES this tool performs well for cutting through and notching wood, metal nails, and plaster. Use ear protection for the noise level and eye protection because you never know and our eyes are precious.\n\nI have yet to use the sander functions but the cutoff blades work satisfactorily leading me to believe that when I get better name brand blades this tool will work that much better- as in less time to saw through something.\n\nThe blades held up well - nothing warped, broke or fell apart. I was worried about the blade failing after reading what happened to other reviewers. Luckily this did not happen to me using the blades that came with the Rockwell Sonicrafter.\n\nThe unit does warm up after using longer than a few moments- such as few times in a row working a few minutes each time. My first project was using this was to cut through some small wood pallet slats and rusted nails. Did the job.  The second project was cutting out a few areas in old plaster. It got dusty, so I made sure to keep the air vents clear and free of debris and the Rockwell did the job.\n\nThe Rockwell Sonicrafter F50 did each task without fail but I wonder if the heating of the unit (something I noticed since the first time using it) is a sign of the eventual demise of the motor.\n\nThe speed control is easy to access and use. The LED light on the unit does not really do much for illuminating a marked guideline, but if I was working in a dark corner or recessed area it should would work well to light up the blade cutting area.\n\nAttaching and releasing the blade is not difficult and secures very well but it is not intuitive. Once you got the flip the lever up, to the side and then crank it around, it is very easy. The instructions could be more descriptive but for good measure I looked up more information  on how to that is provided above by the seller and read other reviewers' pointers.\n\nI like that it comes with its plastic carrying case that fits the blades and tool with room for extra blades and sanding pads.\n\nConclusion: I am happy with my purchase, it is well made and very useful. It is a good value in comparison to other oscillating multi-tools on the market. I am also glad that I have proper ear protection to use to muffle to noise of this tool. *I will update if the heating up of the unit becomes a fail or a cautionary flaw after more projects and when I test the sanding functions.","summary":"Good but Loud","unixReviewTime":1466899200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_691"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CNn+fbaSL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CNn+fbaSL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":1,"vote":"7","verified":true,"reviewTime":"08 1, 2014","reviewerID":"AFV0N28B7PP02","asin":"B00LKL2E0W","style":{"Size:":" 1.75 mm","Color:":" Black","Style:":" PLA 3D"},"reviewerName":"The Good Life","reviewText":"Amazon keeps removing my bad review of this product.

At this point, the printer is paper-weight. The hardware is decent so I've decided to swap the control board with Arudino & Ramp 4.1.  Wish I've gone with another printer. But will have to make lemonade with with lemon I guess.  If you intend on getting Da Vinci, get the cheaper 1.0A and NOT this 2.0A.\n\nUpdate #4:\nAfter nearly a 9 months of usage, left extruder stopped, then filament gear stopped working. It's become an expensive paper weight in office.  Their XYZprinting support is terrible.  Regret in this purchase.\n\nUpdate #3:\nFound this CALIBRATION PROCEDURE works best with less calibrations need between prints:\nStart a demo print. As soon as it warms up and begins to print, watch  extruder head moves over the side print bed and begins the purge line. TURN OFF power before begins purge line.  With printer off; move the extruder head carefully over print bed by hand. Grab towards the top where the filament feeds in to avoid the hot extruder head.\nMove extruder head back left corner. Lay piece of  paper on the bed and slide it under the nozzle. Once the paper is under the nozzle adjust the bed height so you can just feel the paper being grabbed by the nozzle as you slide the paper around. Repeat on all four corners.  Once you are satisfied, move extruder head by hand back to home position (back right corner over the white drip pan).  Turn the power on, go Utilities and select \"Home all axis\".\n\nUpdate #2:\nI had to remove the SD card due to \"0040\" lower memory.  DaVinci support said to re-seat the SD card.  This was not easy to do (had to unscrew circuit board in back panel); but in the process discovered a Class-4, 4Gig SD card.  I replaced this with a Class-10, 8Gig SD card. So far the 0040 error has disappeared.\n\nUpdate #1:\nIt's important to CALIBRATE printer bed before attempting to print; or it will fail. The instruction says the printer was \"Factory Calibrated\" but the bed is still off.  You need to calibrate close(but not exact) to X,Y,Z axis of: 100,100,100.  After EACH print select \"Clean Nozzle\" and brush off excess filament on the metal extruder. If you don't do this; the tiny piece of melted filaments from last print will mix with your new print: resulting in fail. Also, if printing something w/ lots of details or arches; select \"support\" and \"raft\" in Advance print option on XYZprint software.  Orientation of item is also important for successful print. Have sharp razor to pry the model after it's finished; the plastic spatula provided is worthless!  For comparison; a friend who has DaVinci 1.0 said the print quality on 2.0 is better.  This printer unlike alot of other 3D printer comes with a door; what this means the smell of ABS melting and noise from printing is kept low. I can't help but stare at the thing printing for first few minutes; it's almost like baking watching anxiously for your creation to \"rise\" of of nothing.  Finally, I found tinkcad and meshmixer very helpful for modifying and creating 3D model for novice.  My 7yr old was using tinkercad to create army tank with squares and cylinder.\n\nMy first package was lost in during shipping. Amazon sent another next-day only after I sent complaint.\nNow for product review.  The manual says not to calibrate since it's factory-calibrated; but mine would not print and \"Filament Jam\" error until I had to calibrate it several times and had to remove and re-insert the filament.  After that it printed the demo figure fine.\nSo far; I am impressed with printer in its look and print detail.  Only cons: use of proprietary filament cartridge, and XYZ software.","summary":"Good 3D printer","unixReviewTime":1431561600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_693"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xzs0jXchL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mavdx1o9L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NQMf-daWL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bw3qcL1XL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CnlazwjOL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7162I1BiuLL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"03 25, 2016","reviewerID":"A3F7Z4OFA83S85","asin":"B00LNSEZH2","reviewerName":"Amazing Phil","reviewText":"I used to use the test strips to test my drinking water, along with other things (aquariums, etc...) but  after using this handy little gadget, I wonder why I didn't find one of these sooner. I suspect that as time goes by, I will be finding more uses for it. The instructions were pretty basic and easy to follow. I got a gallon of distilled water from the local Walmart for .88 cents. (I also use it in my steam iron, and in the old car battery, so I always have some around). The meter comes in a plastic case which is not very durable (I had loose pieces of it rattling around inside when I got it) but it does give you something to keep it in along with the calibration screwdriver, calibration buffer packets, and instructions.\n\n The instructions called for a 250 ml. glass beaker to mix the calibration solution in. I, being more of a hobbyist rather than a chemist, decided to use a Pyrex measuring cup instead, which worked rather well. I calibrated it using the 4.0 pH.buffer mix after thoroughly rinsing out the cup with distilled water. I then tested the distilled water @ 4.7\n\nOther test results included;\n\nWhite vinegar 5%  2.45\nKroger Big K diet cola  3.1\nBrewed coffee  5.65\nAlmond milk  7.15\nLoveland, CO city water  7.86\nBaking soda and water  8.0\nOxyClean and water  10.8\n\nAll of these results were within the expected range. And I am satisfied with the operation of the meter. After testing these samples, I rinsed the bulb with distilled water before placing the meter back in the calibration solution, and had it reading 4.0 once again. The instructions did not state the need for storing the unit with the bulb immersed in any kind of solution. They merely state that you should rinse the bulb in distilled water before putting the protective cap on. I also do not anticipate the need to calibrate often.\n\nThe green back lighting on the display is a nice touch, and really helps make for easy reading. I see another aquarium in my future, and plan on putting this unit to good use.\n\nI was provided with a free sample in return for my unbiased evaluation.","summary":"Handy little meter for a great price.","unixReviewTime":1458864000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_694"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618WnYbUxRL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":1,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"07 29, 2015","reviewerID":"AWNFFBJ6J1PSW","asin":"B00LNSEZH2","reviewerName":"Robert","reviewText":"Totally inaccurate and could not be calibrated.

This one in particular was rated lower than the others and I hesitated buying it. After trying it out, I have to say that either I am just lucky, or my printer is less picky about filament than others. I'm using an HIC Technology Prusa i3 (which uses a direct-drive extruder) and I have had zero problems with any ABS or PLA Hatchbox filament. In fact, the only filament that I have had any problems with is some silver ABS that I purchased off of Matterhackers.com.  It was more expensive than Hatchbox and so it should be \"better\", but it is definitely not. I tried printing several parts with it today and finally gave up after fighting constant feed issues.\n\nThis filament says it is \"transparent white\", but the filament itself is almost completely clear. Just with the way that a 3D printer prints, it's not going to print parts that are completely clear, of course. But it's about as close to clear as you can get without using clear polycarbonate filament. I received this  filament today and proceeded to print several parts and I was more than satisfied with the results. I'm attaching a few pics so you can see how printed parts will turn out. I shined a laser pointer and an LED through it on two of the pics so you can see how much light gets though. I've also attached pics of the new lid that I made for the 3D-printed case that I made a while back for the CC3D flight controller on my QAV250. The previous lid was black and it was very difficult to see the LEDs on the board. Making it with this material actually makes the LEDs easier to see than it would if it was crystal clear acrylic, due to the way it disperses the light.

Ive read quite a few negative reviews on specifically on this Silver ABS filament and decided to try it anyway. I agree with certain things others have said such as, the print quality of this filament is lower than that of Black ABS or most PLA rolls. There was some blotting on the outer shell, and the layers seem to have trouble melting together, multiple prints ended up separating in the middle of the print, getting stuck to the extruder which dragged it around (separate from the other half of the print still stuck to the bed). Thats an issue I've never had with other Hatchbox Filaments even ABS filaments. I feel like it has something to do with the Silver color, possibly whatever is mixed in it to make it look metallic.

I also have some dental work that makes flossing in the back of my mouth nearly impossible and these Go-Between Cleaners have made a huge difference. The last time I went to the dentist for a cleaning, I was told by the hygienist that it was obvious my dental work was impeding my teeth cleaning, because there was a lot of tartar build-up specifically in that area. Not being able to floss that area or even use a traditional pick, I wasn't sure what I could do (I use a Water Pik, but apparently it can't get those hard to reach trouble spots).\n\nSo, I took a chance on these Go-Betweens and I'm already seeing a huge improvement. At first, my gums were a little swollen after I started using them because I was poking them with the tip of the device (there was a learning curve), but now that I've been using them consistently I perfected my technique and this problem disappeared. In fact, a few days ago I noted that my gums were no longer bleeding in that trouble area after cleaning them, and overall feel much better.\n\nNot only do these work well with tight teeth, but they are also good for awkward positions since the head is flexible and can be bent to an angle that makes accessing difficult to reach areas much easier.

They are in the top of all that I have tried in quality and among the lowest in price! I have used their white, grey and silver metal (does not contain real metal). Their silver is by far my favorite between all of the different brands, it actually is the closest matched to the type that Prusa uses and sells.\n\nAbout the filament:\nPackaging: every roll comes in it's own box and vacuum sealed and a pack of silica gel to make sure any moisture is removed. They also include a few branded stickers, which I actually really enjoy as there were two roughed up patches on the plexiglass I used to make my filament enclosure and the stickers have done a great job to \"cover\" them.\n\nThe filament:\nI have used 7 rolls since this past August and there have had absolutely no jams, snags or any noticeable deviations if any at all in dimension, and every spool was neatly rolled with no crossovers. I've had great success printing at a nozzle temp between 210-212 degrees (depending on the ambient temperature and if I have my AC running in the room), with a bed temp of 60 degrees. Their filament bonds really well and creates very strong and durable pieces. I have noticed that at .1mm height I do need to adjust my settings a little bit and slow the print speed down and increase the hotend a few degrees, but that can be more an issue with the printer and not the filament itself.\n\nI've included a few photos of my assortment of PLA rolls and their stickers, a handful of pieces all printed with their silver PLA and the final piece that was made with them. The final piece was just showcased at ComicCon and everyone asked if it was a resin cast because of how strong it felt.

I have used a ton of Hatchbox PLA without any problems.  But, this spool of PLA has been trouble from the get-go.  First off, and the reason for only 3 stars, is that it's not purple: it's pink.  There's no way around this.  Some might argue that it's a very light purple, but it's pink.  As far as the cursed part goes, I have had numerous issues with this spool of filament that I have not had with any other Hatchbox PLA.  It seemed to need different temp settings for proper extruding.  When it's finally extruding correctly, I've had it bind up on the spool multiple times during long prints.  This is the deal where the windings get on top of each other and then it doesn't feed correctly.  I never had a successful print from this spool.  So, therefore, this PLA is cursed!  Avoid it like the plague!  Avoid cliches, too!\n\nUpdate: I'm increasing my review by a star for Fire Sale Merchant's excellent customer service.  As you can see from the comment on this review, Fire Sale Merchant asked me to contact them about the PLA.  They offered to replace the spool free of charge.  But, I didn't actually buy this filament from Amazon:  a friend purchased this filament for me in exchange for some items that I printed for him.  Otherwise, I would have exchanged the spool immediately.  Nevertheless, Fire Sale Merchant said that they would still replace the filament.  Fire Sale Merchant cares about their product reviews and will apparently do about anything to make things right for their customers.  Kudos to them.\n\nI'll re-appraise this product again upon trying the replacement filament.  But, it's still not purple!  :-)\n\n(I included a photo of one of the failed prints to show what the color actually is.)\n\nUpdate2: The replacement spool that Firesale Merchant sent me works fine.  I did several prints with it with no problems.  So, the first spool really was cursed.  That being said, this still isn't purple!","summary":"Cursed Spool","unixReviewTime":1456185600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_793"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81suUay8ChL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"12 31, 2015","reviewerID":"ATVX9MAVAERYI","asin":"B00MEZDRPO","reviewerName":"Zaeryn 78","reviewText":"Hatchbox filament is the filament of choice around our house.

Im 4th yr Industrial Design student at UL Lafayette and this was my first 3D Printer. I had experience in 3D modeling but our school didn't have a working 3D printer so none of us could print anything, so I decided to buy my own and I'm so glad I did. Its made completing projects MUCH easier and convenient.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS:\nPulling the printer out of the box, it felt sturdy and well built, it was simple to hook up and install the software. The plastic shell was surprisingly thick making the printer feel nice and solid. When you turn on the printer you will hear the sound of the small fans powering on and see the blue LEDs illuminate the inside of the printer (I believe the newest model comes with white LED which is better).\n\nTHOUGHTS:\nWhile this printer does technically come plug and play, there is a learning curve, both digital and mechanical, in order to really get quality prints. When I started my first print I was super excited at how easy it was to start, then was disappointed because the print looked terrible. Luckily ROBO3D.com has a good user forum that is very supportive and they walked me through troubleshooting and the problem ended up being some loose screws that only needed to be tightened. This printer is definitely not perfect, and requires some care, but I haven't had to do anything major to it, so thats understandable in the ever growing 3D printing market. As I said earlier my printer came with blue LED lights inside which look cool, but it doesn't really make for great lighting so I've recently added bright white LED's inside and that made a huge difference and I believe newer models come stock with white LED's. Overall its a good printer for someone who doesn't want to spend $2,000+ but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with more experience. I would like to upgrade in a few years once the 3D printing market has perfected their models a little more.\n\nROBO 3D CUSTOMER SERVICE\nThe warranty part replacement program has been great to me.

There is a line mid-way on her face caused by the PLS fiber getting tangled on the spool which is a common occurance on all 3d printers. That is why you should never leave the unit unattended.\n\nAnyways, much more fun than my Siegel X3 CEC conversion! No, it doesn't do metal, yet but I think Dremel is on the right track. They should make their own unit though. The re-branded thing is ok to start with but this is where it's all headed so they should start making it a priority!\n\nNotice Milwaukee and Ryobi haven't got a unit out yet? Dremel is a head of the curve!\n\n**UPDATE: After printing for 500+ hours now with this unit I have to say this; The printer is generally good but the included software is crap (and I'm being generous). Believe it or not but the quality of the prints is nearly 100% in the software. I would HIGHLY suggest you spend the extra $150.00 at[...] and truly open the Dremel 3D Printer up! I was putting 0.25mm or greater tolerances in all of my parts because the dimensional shifts that would happen before using Simplify3D. After I got Simplify3D all of my parts turn out as they are in the CAD program (in my case Rhino3D). Another thing is after a while when you get comfortable you can open up the advanced settings and start tweaking things you simply have no access to in the Dremel branded software. Simplify3D has a section on their Web site where you can see images of print problems with a list of suggestions for changes in the parameters to solve them. Customer service was great and the community seems very active and willing to help. When I imagined what a 3D printer was and then saw the original output from the Dremel branded software I was disappointed but happy I was \"close.\" Now I'm spot on and it is like having a new printer!

Hill","reviewText":"This LED endoscope is attached to a sixteen foot cable and has a USB plug on the end. The length of the cable creates the capability to access many hidden or hard to reach locations so the back and interior of a variety of things may be easily viewed. It also comes with a small group of accessories to help view and retrieve lost items and obstructions.\n\nWith an ingress rating of IP67, the camera is completely protected against dust intrusion and is immersion protected for short periods of time in water. The information I found elsewhere which explained the definition of this rating defined pressure and time limitations of up to 1 meter (just over three feet) of submersion with a test duration of 30 minutes measured at the bottom of the cable, and at least 15 cm (about six inches) measured at the top of the device. I did not have a clogged pipe to thread this camera through but I won't hesitate to do it next time it happens.\n\nAfter reading the included User Manual I copied the enclosed 3 inch CD to my laptop hard drive. The disc contains three applications and when I double clicked on the first one it said no capture device available so I plugged the endoscope into my USB port and the message went away but the screen was blank except for some menus. So, I closed that window and double clicked on the second application and it was also a blank screen with some menus, so I closed that one too.\n\nWhen I double clicked on the third application the screen opened and the picture from the endoscope was in view. From there I tested the camera in a variety of locations and followed the instructions to capture snapshots which I have attached to this review. The software can also be used to create videos.\n\nIn addition, there was a .rar file on the included disc that when uncompressed contains a program called ViewPlayCap which can be installed on a PC by running the setup file. It is much easier to use than the other three applications on the disc. If interested in loading this program the user will need software to uncompress a .rar file such as 7Zip.\n\nThe LED lens is bright and has a wheel adjustment control on the USB plug so the light may be set for best advantage in different conditions. I removed a floor vent cover and saw bug remains in the ductwork. Then I checked behind the dryer for dust, and found some (and cleaned it, of course) but it did not make a very compelling photo so I took a picture of the label on the back of the dryer to show the clarity of the image. And finally, I took a picture behind some audio video equipment. This area is always difficult to get at and the endoscope provided a way to check empty ports and confirm tight connections.\n\nThe cost is modest considering many 16 foot cables alone are priced in this range. This endoscope has many uses and the only limitations I noticed were minor. When used in a large space the cable was difficult to precisely direct so time was required to maneuver it into position. But, it is perfect to thread into tight spots, like a car engine, and with patience, it works just fine in larger openings.

It makes the system look a little goofy, but who really cares, I'm using a thermal camera on my phone! I've attached pictures.\n\nOriginal:\nI couldn't help but buy one of these! Thermal vision for $215? Yes please!

I'm wondering if it's a patent issue with Flir. If they tried, I'm sure they could find some legal way to overlay or at least compare a normal and thermal image...\n*Scenes where the temperature is fairly uniform are very grainy (put something even 10 warmer in the scene and the image clears up significantly)\n*Won't plug into a phone with a heavy case on. My Note 4 with Unicorn Beetle case needed an extension, and my Note 7 already needs an adapter, but still. I don't know why the frame wasn't made just a little longer. Most people put cases on their phones.\n\nMiddle Ground:\n*There's a focus ring on the standard Seek now. I'm not sure if this is great or terrible. It's nice to be able to focus, but focusing with such a low resolution image is a guessing game... I'm not sure if an infinite focus would be better or not.\n*The camera calibration clicking isn't a problem for me, though it does seem to have trouble when the camera is pointed straight up (it's much better than a manual calibration!). This click is audible on videos shot with the camera, but if you're shooting a Hollywood movie, you probably want other audio sources anyways...\n\nIn conclusion, I would certainly buy this again!

As far as I can tell, you can only get the temperature at one or two points at the time the image is taken.","summary":"Incredible value!","unixReviewTime":1428364800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_861"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41xDRaplBiL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"12","verified":false,"reviewTime":"03 14, 2015","reviewerID":"A2R1HUYHXV7H18","asin":"B00NYWABAA","style":{"Size:":" XR","Style:":" Android"},"reviewerName":"Bugs","reviewText":"You can check your phone for compatibility at their website, they maintain a list there that is easy to use. But also your Android version must be 4.3 or higher. (Note that AT&T has stated they will only add up to 4.2 to their HTC One X ROM.) The application to use the camera can be found at the Google Play store, just search for SEEK THERMAL and it is easy to find. It will let you know if your Android version is compatible or not as well if you want to check it before purchase.\n\nThe case is very hard to open and WILL break long nails. I need a flathead screwdriver to open it. It's very protective, it just shuts too tight. Too tight. It comes with a small keying in case you want to keep it on a key-chain. I leave my keys in my grocery shopping cart while shopping too often for that.\n\nThe unit itself is very small and very light. It is secured to the phone only by the micro-USB port. It seems a weakness in the design, it would be nice if it were a replaceable snap-in module in the design should that connection fail. It would be even nicer if it could be taken out,rotated around, then put back in, so that it would fit more phones.\n\nOn my HTC, it fits on the side of my phone but the port faces wrong. I had to get this extension cable to make it work: YCS Basics 6 inch USB Micro male to female OTG extension cable It works, but makes it a bit more difficult to juggle. While I was waiting on the cable, I was able to use it with a couple of USB extension cables and USB to micro cables I had. I do find that the shorter cable is easier. Either way, it's inconvenient and makes the device harder to juggle with the cable. I find I have to use two hands.\n\nThe thermal imager works well. The images don't have to be gray scale, they can be changed to several different color schemes. The temperature point can also be set, so if it is 70 degrees at room temp, you can set the device to that, and then it will read anything more cold, or hotter, than that. All the settings are in the application itself and nothing has to be done to the camera unit itself. Paranormal researchers could use this feature to find cold spots.\n\nThe camera can be used to spot wildlife, leaks in pipes, areas where there are energy leaks, or electrical shorts. If you point it at a grill or baking stone, it can tell you the approximate temperature, but it does better at a more distant range.\n\nI like the camera and what it does, and the application is VERY nice. I just think the camera has several design issues that could be improved to make it more easily compatible with phones that have ports that are `backwards' and a few other little things. For instance, I think a lens cap would have been a nice addition to include. There are no paper instructions with the unit, but just playing with the application, it is easy to learn.","summary":"Some smartphones will need an extra cable, check compatibility, nice application","unixReviewTime":1426291200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_862"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41OJKNdwAsL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41+V93dRjaL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41NhJUSiTVL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41oocWAxxXL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"36","verified":true,"reviewTime":"03 4, 2015","reviewerID":"A3ASET5JYKE87C","asin":"B00NYWABAA","style":{"Size:":" XR","Style:":" Android"},"reviewerName":"Cathy","reviewText":"This neat little thermal camera is ideal for troubleshooting or monitoring electrical systems.

You can see the photos at the end of the photo sequence below.  Hopefully mine is the only exception.  The top side was clean, but rotating them over 90 degrees was an entirely different story. A simple firm wipe didn't remove that debris either. It took soap and water and a rough washcloth to get it off.  It's okay now, but there is absolutely no excuse for filthy toothbrushes this expensive or any other price for that matter.  Philips, wake up and get your factory clean!\n\nI have owned a different model Philips Sonicare toothbrush since December 2014.  I liked it, but it just didn't seem to have the cleaning power of a rotating toothbrush like the Oral-B Pro 5000 I've owned since May 2015.  I've used both of these toothbrushes daily, using the Oral-B in the mornings and nighttime and the Philips Sonicare in the daytime.  However, everything has changed with this new model with the addition of a new high power mode.  When I first used the older Philips Sonicare it felt like a surprisingly strong sensation, but I grew accustomed to it quickly.  Then I wanted something more powerful and the Oral-B satisfied that need.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Philips-Sonicare-2-Series-Plaque-Control-Sonic-Electric-Rechargeable-Toothbrush-HX6211-30/dp/B00KZHP1GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Philips Sonicare 2 Series Plaque Control Sonic Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush, HX6211/30</a>\n\nBy the way, the Sonicare above is quite good, but just not as intense. When I went to the dentist for semi-annual cleaning using the above toothbrush, the hygienist didn't seem to notice any difference.  I don't normally accumulate much plaque anyway, so I suppose that wasn't a big surprise.  I attribute that to flossing three to four times per day without exception after each meal or snack.  I'm 73 and my teeth are still quite healthy whereas both my parents had false teeth in their forties. Fluoride was a major factor.  So I've adopted a strict regimen of high fluoride toothpaste, dental flossing and within the past several years, electric toothbrushes.  Prior to that I thought a regular soft bristle toothbrush was fully equivalent.  But there is a shortcoming in the lower jaw that the dentist pointed out. Right handed people miss a location and left handed people miss on the opposite side.  Interesting.  So I bought into the electric toothbrush.  I started with the Philips Sonicare in the link below.  I really need to replace the brush head, but now I am going to use it for my Invisalign retainer tray cleaning task.  Yes, I finally got my teeth straightened at age 68 and it worked - $4200 well spent.\n\nI am pleased to get two of these for sure.  My wife is 44 years younger and she has just finished her Invisalign sequence and will pick up her permanent retainers next week.  Between cavities and Invisalign, I have a major investment to protect - for both of us.  Now that Philips has implemented the high power mode, I can put the Oral-B toothbrush aside and use only this new Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  I never did understand the need for Bluetooth on a toothbrush anyway  mostly a gimmick in my opinion.  And Im a technologist, too.  So I know how to connect Bluetooth easily.  My wife may want to start off in the Sensitive Mode and graduate up to the maximum setting.  It is her first experience.  For me, I want all the sonic power I can get.\n\nSo about the only difference I can see between the $39.95 model I have owned for a long time and the new one is the two other settings.  So why is that worth tripling the price or worse?  So weve come from dollar toothbrushes to $10 electric rotary battery toothbrushes to suddenly $128 toothbrushes?  It can't be the lithium battery. Look at the huge lithium batteries on my lawn equipment for far less money.\n\nIm confused about the model Im reviewing. I received a two-pack and it is referring me to what looks like a single toothbrush link. Something doesnt seem quite right. You should shop and do some research to find the best price.  But I can say with certainty you need the third speed or intensity to do the best job. Look for the three small lights one above another on the front below the big green on-off button.","summary":"Beyond Excellent.  Major Improvement in Sonic Intensity.  Oral-B Pro 5000 Beware.

I've always been fan of shop vacs (for their raw power) when it comes to heavy duty cleaning needs and cordless uprights/handhelds for convenience and every day use. I wondered if this Shark could come anywhere close to the suction power of small sized shop vac or have anywhere near the convenience of an upright.\n\nUpon it's arrival I was immediately intrigued by the marketing tout right on the box-- the proclamation that Shark vacuums have \"More 5 star online reviews than any other brand\". That really piqued my interest and I couldn't wait to find out if this machine was going to live up to the high expectations that the Shark company was setting up for it.\n\nIf looks could kill, taking this machine out of the box could be a fatal affair. Is this really vacuum cleaner? It looks too good. With it's jewel-tone metallic paint like finish and giant spoked looking wheels this thing evokes a futuristic souped-up hot rod you might see in a Star Wars film. After looking it over and enjoying it's sharp looks, I began some knuckle tests and feeling & poking around, looking for weaknesses. It was initially impressive, even an engineering marvel in it's overall design. The hose, which sometimes is the weakest link in a vacuum, is nice and sturdy. Although there is obviously a lot of plastic used, it felt pretty solid and not cheaply made.\n\nOne of the first functional things that I noticed were the two large rectangular buttons on the top of the canister, one for power and the other to withdraw the power cord. I really appreciated the size and placement of these. I then tried the removal and replacement of the dirt compartment a few times and found that to be a smooth and simple procedure. Of course then I just had to try the \"Lift-Away\" feature. You simply step on a lever at the back of the canister and lift the main part up by it's handle and away it goes. It's very simple and clever. As soon as I did that I spied the crevice and brush attachments which are stowed in the base (that bottom part with the wheels). My initial impression of this Lift-Away feature was that while it is nice, you really almost feel like you are not really leaving much behind. Most of the weight of the unit is in the motor and and such. It becomes a little more portable as you leave behind the wheel assembly and small attachments, but not in a dramatic way.\n\nI moved on to the \"click\" assembly/dis-assembly between the parts, those being the hose, wand and three cleaning heads. This is where I encountered one issue. All the \"click\" connection between all of the parts worked smoothly, except for the connection between the wand and the motorized head. I expected it to require a bit of extra force to lock in since there is also a power connection involved, but I sensed that something was wrong. At first I could not even get it to lock in. I inserted it with a push just like the other connections, the motor was powered up and it appeared to be in place but it slipped right back out when trying to use it. After some effort I found that it took a LOT of force to make the connection so that it would lock in place. I thought that this was perhaps a quality control issue, since I could not imagine it being designed to require THAT much force (I had to use some body weight or even pick it up and sort of hammer it in).\n\nI decided to call Shark to inquire. I tried to convey to the rep that it seemed to require much more force to attache the motorized head than the other connections. Initially she told me several times that this was normal and that it was due to the power connection. I tried to better emphasize the amount of force that it was requiring, but she still seemed reluctant to think that it was a QC or manufacturing  issue. I thought back to the quip on the box (\"most five star reviews') and thought something was wrong here, so I pressed further and sensing my growing irritation she finally relented (albeit with a reluctant and patronizing tone) and said that if I REALLY wanted it, they would send out a replacement wand and motorized head. I asked for the replacement head alone, since the wand worked just fine with the other pieces. I am currently awaiting receipt of that replacement head and will update on this issue and perhaps put up a short video.\n\nIn the meantime, I am putting the vacuum through it paces around the house. I have to say that so far I am impressed with the suction. It is no wimp.  More to come as I become more familiar with this interesting machine.\n\nUpdate: I have since received the replacement motorized head and have discovered that the initial head that came with my vacuum did indeed have a defect. The replacement clicks in quite easily and I am very happy with it's operation. I had even received an automated message from Shark letting me know that the replacement part had shipped and it's tracking number. The initial unfortunate customer service phone call experience is all but forgotten from my mind.\n\nAs I use the vacuum more I am discovering that there are a lot of small details that I've really come to appreciate. One that stands out is the notch the back of the canister for hooking the wand onto so that it stands upright. It is so simple but it works and is super convenient.\n\nIf you have any questions about this vacuum before I can fill this review up with every detail, please ask and I will do my best to answer.","summary":"My First Encounter With a Shark","unixReviewTime":1430956800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_879"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zzDwOnL5L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":2,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"02 14, 2015","reviewerID":"A24IXXBFQ10EWU","asin":"B00PCCWEJG","reviewerName":"Christopher Hiller","reviewText":"I haven't used these headers yet, but I'm sure they work fine.\n\nBut, please see the attached photograph of how the headers arrived.\n\nI'm not a tree-hugger, but I think reasonable person would find this to be ridiculous.","summary":"Might explain the inflated price...","unixReviewTime":1423872000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_880"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iJwVDSb1L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"05 24, 2016","reviewerID":"A21AENI8UFLYDS","asin":"B00PF7EPCM","reviewerName":"Daniel","reviewText":"When I got into 3d printing, I asked a friend who has already 2+ years in 3d printing, what is the best filament to use.

I am still learning all the things it does!\n\nI was worried that maybe 8-bit resolution would not be enough, but it works just fine or everything I need it for.  Think of this as more than just a DSO (Digital Storage Oscilloscope).  It is a multi-tester - you can get realtime readouts of many many different measurements right next to the waveform, such as Vrms, Vp-p, frequency, Mean volts, max volts, min volts, etc.  So kind of like having a DMM right in the scope.  The screen is extremely clear, bright, and easy to read.  Many trigger modes, acquire modes - like I said, still learning how to use it.  FFT built-in, I could go on and on.  The spec sheet does not give this unit justice, because it is difficult to describe all of the things it does.  You can even trigger on the width of a pulse!  Set a width (time), and it can be set to trigger for smaller pulses, larger pulses, or pulses within 5% of your setting.  While I have not needed that, I can imagine that might be extremely useful!  Catch a 5ns glitch!  Set to trigger for less than 6ns width!  WOW.\n\nYes, you can see some digital artifacts but they are down in the noise - like 24 dB down.  In other words, working with 1 volt full scale (that would be 8 major divisions) you would have digitization noise at 4mv - which is 1/32 of a major division.  This is so small, it is not really an issue for almost all cases.\n\nI included a photo of the scope showing it reading the built-in square wave for testing the scope probes, and showing the \"measurement\" display next to the waveform.  This measurement is accessed by pressing a single button, what you want to measure can be changed with a single button (F6), and the panel can be removed with a single button (F0).\n\nI love it!\n\nAnd yes, I realize that this level of technology is only available from China because of the extremely low wages...

I'm not simply talking about the fact that it's heated (that's quite common), but instead I'm referring to the PEI surface coating that the bed has. Bed adhesion is big issue among almost all 3D printers, and in forum after forum people discuss the use of hairspray, tape, and glue to ensure proper bed adhesion. I have had to use NONE of these methods and have been able to print both PLA and ABS perfectly directly to the bed's surface and have experienced no warping.\n\nI have used this printer both connected to my computer, as well as a Raspberry Pi running OctoPi and both have performed admirably. The open source Cura software that is available for download from their site has been really fantastic to work with. I have moved on to using Simplify3d as my slicer, but only because I wanted some of the advanced features such as manual supports and Vase mode, but the printer has been producing superb quality prints with both slicers.\n\nI did run into an issue once where I had been feeding 1.75mm filament for a job that I left unattended, which ended up failing due to \"Heat creep\" which is when the temperature is set a bit too high and the filament gets heated a bit too high and causes kinks in the filament. This ultimately led to a deep PLA blockage in my hot end. A quick email to customer service got me a response within 30 minutes that helped me clear the clog without any further issues.\n\nThe one issue I do have with this printer is that it's designed to use 3mm filament which is not as readily avaliable locally, and although I've ran quite a few successful prints with 1.75mm filament (many people run it without issue), the rate of print failures is still a lot higher with it. Since I've mostly been printing lately with 3mm filament, I've not run into many issues with the printer's performance. The print build area is a bit smaller than some more expensive models, but I knew that going in and wanted to stick my toes into the 3D printing arena without spending too much money. That being said, when I'm ready to move up to a bigger print area, I will most definitely be looking at their higher end TAZ line of printers.\n\nPros:\nAuto-bed leveling\nHigh quality metal frame\nFantastic PEI bed surface for great adhesion\nFantastic customer service\nCompact enough to fit on my desk with both a monitor and my Network storage box\nMesmerizes my cats for hours on end\n\nCons:\n3mm filament not as common as 1.75mm\nCats refuse to play with the cat toys I print out for them","summary":"I absolutely love almost every piece of this printer","unixReviewTime":1438041600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_929"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414giTfNwBL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41NU0DZXViL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lgjWjwRgL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41L7k9RlU7L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41BPTISiaoL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41QYzUjxE2L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41fNo7eMfCL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41t6GsRhXXL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41sINptMG5L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Yb32zdaDL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41tZbfjODIL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41j5KEgJkPL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41oDxLQxJ9L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41xfdxYqbiL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31Zuy-QCq-L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41bYUvEh5OL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41PnA5HAxPL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41dffFR-FVL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":1,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"08 7, 2016","reviewerID":"A36TXJVACY60VF","asin":"B00SAEHA56","style":{"Size:":" 2lb","Color:":" White"},"reviewerName":"Salrous","reviewText":"Oh god were do I begin.\nI only tried PLA 3mm I wanted to try ABS but now with the bad results I got I don't have the motivation, I am going to review this filament on my Youtube channel and live print and compare it with other PLA as well but for here this is my review:\n1. its inconsistant with its diameter, the tolerance of error is very large it can go from 2.90mm to 3.5mm at times, I hardly had consistency with this PLA.\n2. it does not print good quality and warp as if it was ABS, I found that weird but I have pictures to back me up.\n3. it variate very quickly to temperature change, I usually set 210 for PLA and this brand either don't flow good less than 205 or at 210 it start stringing.\n\nI printed examples, 2 different brands, white is IC3D and Green is ColorFabb and you can judge for your self\nI don't advise you buy this PLA its expensive for the bad quality.\nand it causes jam in my printer and I have pictures of that as well","summary":"PLA is at poor quality, it inconsistent and will jam your Extruder","unixReviewTime":1470528000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_930"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MJYtG9wsL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":2,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"12 20, 2017","reviewerID":"AWJFQ8YE2MGM8","asin":"B00SAEEMHK","style":{"Size:":" 2lb","Color:":" White"},"reviewerName":"John B","reviewText":"Product description for the White 1.75mm PLA is a lie.

Mine came with Zero instructions/manual.  These \"K\" type thermo-couples DO have a polarity, but is not well indicated on both the instrument, or the individual probes.  So put on your Opti-Visor and get your thinnest Sharpie to mark it up.  Each probe has a very small \"+\" sign on the plug .. just graze the \"plus\" with your Sharpie.  The plug well is also marked very faintly .. Plus goes to the rear .. Minus facing you.  I also numbered them on the plugs .. to reduce some confusion as I place all four probes.\n\nAs to accuracy, it's gotta be better than what I get with either of my infra-red hand-held thermometers.  At ambient temperature .. about 72*f, all four probes are within 0.9*f, which is certainly adequate for my application.  My application is a 10KVA 440vac transformer converted to an 80 amp 60 volt battery charger .. running off of 220.  The hand-helds show temps that are way high between the coils, and for $33 bucks, this instrument should put my concerns to rest, or prompt some additional thermal modeling.  Lost a star due to lack of a manual/instructions, but it's pretty simple/intuitive, as long as you plug in the probes with their correct polarity.

The probes are measuring inside and the outside of left coil, the base of the bridge heat-sink on 3, and the 200A fuse on probe 4.  Probe 4 was later simply placed inside the blast cover, without tape or thermal goop, for a much more accurate (and dramatically higher) reading.  In following instructions for an $800 unit, I found that by holding the Backlight Button IN, while powering up, the unit will stay ON, until you intentionally power it Off, which for me in my application, was my complaint.  I'll continue to use it for thermal modeling/placement of 4 x 80mm fans for forced air cooling. 5 Stars","summary":"Temps show within 0.9*f at 72*f ambient ..

With almost 1000 hrs of print time, it seemed like a good time to look for its replacement, since I assumed technology has advanced.  While reading the reviews of the Makerbot 5th gen, a very disturbing trend emerged.  One third of the five star reviews occurred on just a single day (10/14/2014)- while not one day of one-star reviews- of which there are twice as many- had two reviews.  Similarly, the positive reviews were brief, and often by Amazon users with no or very few other reviews, opposite of the one star reviews. I created a chart (hopefully it makes it through) to show the distribution of 1 and 5 star reviews by date- it speaks for itself.  Draw your own conclusions- but I'm staying clear of this product.\n\nUPDATE: I initially only looked at five-star reviews for \"tampering\"- but the four-stars are off as well.  3 of the 8 four-star reviews were done on Oct 22nd (the same day as two five-stars), and 1 of the 8 four-stars was on the same day as the ridiculous \"big day\" (Oct 14th, 2014) for five-star reviews.  That almost definitely makes many (most?) positive reviews false.  If the suspicious four and five star reviews are discounted, the 5th Gen gets a total score of around 1.6 stars (vice 2.36, as of Feb 15, 20015).

But I can agree with him.\n\nThe 3 star review is from a more typical user, and what he tells you is that it hardly wowed him, and I can believe in his lack of wow, wowness? Wow factor! There we go. Let's talk about this to determine the reason for both reviews being valid to me.\n\nFor those who haven't noticed my many audio product reviews on amazon, in which I expel my own brand of BS about audio until I should probably also link to baby wipes, here's the deal. As a kid I managed to get trained in a recording facility, I did a couple years in TV production and triumphantly heard my own national broadcast radio commercial aired in 1990 from my own facility while still using 2 inch tape, and things improved after that. So nearing 51 now, I'm at times referred to as an old, but wise man in this industry,....Do I get the job!\n\nI was asked by a reader who seems to like me instead of just putting up with me, to review the SMSL M6, and I said that I have no need for such a device and would think about it, because I really do try for you guys, it was just that I have so many unused headphone amps already and I'm not really a headphone guy, although I have about 80 of them.\n\nSo instead, I concocted a plan to smooth talk Gemini Doctor into a 50% discount on this Sanskrit instead, pleading with them that because of  my previous product purchases from them and reviews on those, combined with the fact that I was down to my last can of soup, really made it the only fair thing to do. The Sanskrit is the M6 without the headphone amp it includes, and so this is still relevant to it anyway.\n\nI've got to tell you though, it's because for the past 25 years I've been offered free and discounted recording and musical products from both manufacturers and dealers for testing or just as gifts, but not for reviewing purposes. Because until about 6 years ago when my health problems caught up to me, I've just been a working man and I while had no need for this particular product, how does that help you guys out? So paying $52 and testing it for a couple of weeks is no big deal to me. I have no idea if I'm suppose to declare or whatever that I purchased this at half price, but I did, and yet it was more expensive than the last $500 piece of audio gear that was given to me free from a manufacturer to test as a prototype before it being offered on the market for sale, which is something that I've done many times. Tell me to shut up now, really I'm embarrassed by it all and will likely purchase one just because I am, and so that I can edit all this out.\n\nLet's talk about digital to analog conversion, which started long before my own era, and I started with a 1/4 inch 4 track reel to reel at only 7.5 ips. I point that out because I owned products in the 70's using ADA (analog-digital-analog which was a guitar stomp box brand) and it's not so new today, this stuff is as old as me which surprises many who are my kids age.\n\nThe Sanskrit 6th anniversary edition will convert your digital audio files to analog audio and you can connect to it optically at only a 16 and 24 bit depth and asynchronous USB or using coax at a 16-32 bit depth with all sampling at 32k-192k per second determined by it's input stream using the Wolfson WM8740 chip and that all sounds impressive, very impressive doesn't it? Not much about this page seems to be focused on it's analog stereo output from it's RCA/phono jacks though, it must need it's own numbers advertised! Because everyone loves numbers and the bigger the better, unless it's your waist size. Where the real problem lies is that advertising loves numbers too, the incarnate of Satan upon Earth loves numbers too. In order to combat this Beelzebub you must try to understand those numbers displayed by advertising for all electronics, so,....\n\nAll of you who have recorded the same analog signal at 44.1k/16 and 48k/24 and then played them back through the same equipment listening for the difference in digital quality, raise your hand,...I thought so, and it's because mostly only a studio owner would do this. But why test when there are numbers to go by? Wait, I think you could play a song on a movie track and then switch the playback quality in Windows to 44.1k/16 to hear it again to perform this test, right? I'm not sure, but try it and see what you hear if this works. When tested with very nice equipment, there can be a very slight difference between the two, but only when the recorded audio signal itself allows for hearing it, because most signals won't go from silent to max output and this is why it became the standard for the cinema, where it will more so than music. So 16 bit theoretically only allows for a 96.3 dB range from the quietest sound to the loudest and 24 bit raises that number to 144 dB.\n\nSo that's why you need it! A bigger number! Um, no, not really. Because in order to hear that increased dynamic range from the file the rest of your equipment will need to provide a matching dynamic range of 144 dB. Which you won't have because your amp is most likely between 100 and 110 dB which being next in the signal path it will determine the dynamic range of what you hear. Then you'll need to listen the right type of quiet and loud dynamic tracks from your file in perfect silence without any ambient sound to hear the increase in the dynamic range from that equipment that you don't have to reach the possible 144 dB from your file. Most of today's popular music is only loud and louder anyway and probably uses only a fraction of the 96.3 dB dynamic range normally from it's quiet to loud passages. If you do try testing as I suggest that you do, you'll need a good headphone setup to have any hope of hearing the difference between 44.1k/16 and 48k/24 through the same equipment with only the conversion rate changing. But what about the 48k to 192k instead of 44.1k, those bigger numbers must improve the audio quality, right? After all, bigger numbers are better.\n\nThink of a sideways S and how it can represent an audio waveform. Now we will sample that audio wave 44,100 times each second to recreate it in a digital file and that's a lot of times, but it can't be a perfectly smooth sideways S when recreated, can it? Well no it can't, but we have a hard time imagining the universe as we know it too. By increasing the amount of samples per second it has to become a smoother reproduction of the original, however again most would never hear that as a change in their audio reproduction. Since each sample is also a bit of information stored, the file size increases and there is a point of diminishing returns in this quest for perfection in rebuilding the original analog waveform.\n\nThe industry decided on 48k for that reason and no one can hear the difference between 44.1k and 48k when at the same 16 bit depth, but creating an imaginary improvement was okay with the cost of storing digital information decreasing and since 24 bit could slightly improve dynamic range, why not include 48k with it as the new standard, 48k/24. But when playing back these two different standards using very nice gear, few would ever notice any difference and this standard is a huge jump in the possible improvement of the audio reproduction over 44.1k/16, and that's what is important to understand. If you understand that, and that this digital conversion process is just one tiny part of the whole involved in digitally reproducing analog audio and that it alone can't make a huge difference, you'll understand why a much smaller improvement like doubling or tripling the amount of samples to recreate the waveform doesn't wow any studio engineer, much less our three star reviewer, who most likely never made use of above 48k samples per second anyway. Will you?\n\nSo it only makes sense that using above 48/24 should really be left to the multi track recording professionals in most cases. where it will eventually be mixed to a final track to be played on the public's players, or worse, within a compressed file. Because any potential gain above 48k/24 would be noticed 30x more when combining 60 digital audio tracks into the two for stereo in the case of what this product uses, to be played back at 44.1k/16 or 48k/24 through consumer equipment. The first standard being almost perfect and the second being better digital reproduction than what you're able to play back with today's amps, unless you happen to have incredible equipment that you listen to in an anechoic chamber. While there are amps that reach 135 dB for around 3G's that you can purchase, I don't think that many shopping on this page own one. So then using a 32 bit depth really doesn't even make sense and I rarely waste my storage space using above 96K when recording, but in my case I'm charging money for using it it.\n\nThere is more to all of this and I'm using theoretical numbers and I'm not looking to write a scientific paper here, so spare me any arguments. When listening in a studio control room using expensive gear like at my recording facility, these numbers above 48k/24 really mean squat to this engineer. Factually, the average Joe listener can't hear the difference between a 256k MP3 file and a CD quality file so how can they hear the difference between a 48k vs a 96k file? So I'm saying it straight up, don't make this purchase because of the big numbers that it has above 48k/24 or you'll be thinking that it's 3 stars too. But earlier I mentioned the RCA/phono outputs that the Sanskrit uses without any headline numbers or boasting at all about them, and I think that even Joe might hear the difference with good or bad output amps, because they can make a pretty big difference in the audio reproduction.\n\nThe End\n\nHere we have something really worthy of testing, the output amps. The Sanskrit output amps have a dynamic range of 113 dB,...Excellent, but not 144 dB like 24 bit. The rest of the specifications all look excellent also for an inexpensive converter. It uses the common unbalanced output of 2.0Vrms, with the same THD+N as the pro gear often used in recording your music and a signal to noise ratio of 115 dB and all the specs on the Sanskrit outputs are great numbers worthy of a headline.\n\nSo I just listened to the Sanskrit quite a bit for over a week connected as you see in my photos. I connected it USB from one of my audio towers and to a SMSL Q5 to power a pair of Polk Monitor 40's, and if that sounds familiar it's because I purchased 3 pair of them on sale at $100 a pair. I also plugged the cable into a Win 10 laptop and just started listening, no hassle and trouble free. Unfortunately, as nice as the Q5 sounds with it's FFX output stage it has only a 100 dB dynamic range that doesn't bother me at all.\n\nI'll give studio tracks a second or third listen in this room, so it has some conditioning work done to it to reduce the worst of the acoustical problems so it's a real good average listening room and that's my whole design idea here. I normally have a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Focusrite-Saffire-6-audio-interface/dp/B002R9ILOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Focusrite Saffire 6 audio interface</a>&nbsp;connected for USB output from the tower to another Q5 connected to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Alesis-6-inch-two-way/dp/B00IWRG31I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Alesis 6 inch two way</a>&nbsp;passive studio monitors. Now I have a good place to check the tracks mastered in the studio, not high end or low end, just good and average. I have a few of these rooms to critique tracks in, well, maybe 8 of them all together. It also makes it a good place for comparing the Sanskrit to a good home recording DAC like the Saffire though.\n\nI'm able to switch USB audio outputs from the tower into each interface and both are connected to Q5's to listen to the same file and also physically plug into either amp from the same interface. Now I'm able to verify that the output amp on the SMSL sounds every bit as good as what the $250 Saffire uses, maybe better but my equipment in this room is making my judgement unreliable, but I'm not done testing yet.\n\nI was able to insert it into a nice recording system where it could be connected optically. This was inserted as two of 32 digital to analog playback tracks that go into a mixing console, where the other 30 are from very expensive studio equipment, several thousands of dollars worth of DACs all from my workstation. I could listen to any of them through two different sets of near fields and one pair of mid field monitors, besides a couple pair of headphones from the headphone out on this expensive console to make comparisons between the different DACs, while using the same file and input type at the same 96k/24 resolution.\n\nThe Sanskrit can hold it's own in this demanding situation. 16 of these would make a fine 32 channel studio playback system for me and probably does in another companies pro gear, using some of the same electronics used within the Sanskrit. So after all that I've told you about buying this or any DAC, here's the bottom line on purchasing a Sanskrit of your own.\n\nI chose to purchase a better, longer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/more-noise-free-ferrite-cable/dp/B003MQ29B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">more noise free ferrite cable</a>&nbsp;to connect this USB, but what it comes with, will work just fine for you, I wanted it longer. I always recommend using external DAC's because of all the electrical noise inside a computer's case, so just physically doing that will improve your sound quality.\n\nMy own 20 something year old/young ears found 44.1k/16 to be just about perfect at reproducing an analog signal way back in the early 90's when much testing was going on against reel to reel and I was a part of it, and one time with 9 other engineers in a room trying to tell which was which, it's not easy giving up your $20k reel to reel except for the cost of 2 inch tape. So the hype of the larger conversion numbers doesn't work on me because you can't get better than perfect, which I consider 48k/24 to be. But all output stages in DAC's or audio interfaces aren't equal after the digital conversion takes place, and whatever the Sanskrit is using for analog output amps, is very nice sounding to my ears today. And yes, I'll pull it apart and see if I can tell you what it's using, I'll update. I've just been very busy.\n\nIt only has a switch for it's three inputs and no separate power switch, you hold the Select switch to power it on a off and when I plugged it into a TV optically it just worked, but not all TV's are the same and you might have to change some settings on yours. Honestly, I mostly watch internet TV from bed, which then lulls me to sleep.\n\nI also plugged it into an Android 4.4 tablet using OTG cable and I needed a USB app to make it work, my Mac Mini is at another home, sorry guys, but I'll try it when I fly over there, but we know that it will work anyway with OS X 10.6 or newer. iOS 5.0 is listed as well as Linux.\n\nThe Sanskrit is an excellent choice as an external converter from Win XP through 10, because it's analog outputs sound very nice, but it might not be much of an upgrade from another external converter. So any review claiming that this sounds and works great, is absolutely correct from my own testing. If I can't tell a difference from it and a $3000 piece of gear playing back in a studio control room, it sounds good.\n\nBut the guy who wasn't impressed is right also. It's hard for a guy like me with years of training my ears to hear a real difference using a setup like the Q5 and Monitor 40's in a decent room playing uncompressed files tested against the Saffire. So when used in any lesser situation using just any file quality and heard with average ears, I predict nothing but shoulder shrugs about it from most people, and why not? I think that he would feel the same about&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/This-One/dp/B0041EEPV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">This One</a>, except that his savings would drop even lower, but to me the Avid is worth every penny.\n\nIt's really about choosing a DAC for your new system and how much you should spend with them starting at under $50, I happen to have a $50 Creative 5.1 DAC that I use in stereo with near field studio monitors connected and this DAC will be an upgrade, although it's mostly used as a normal computer for me which includes video editing and watching TV and movies occasionally on it's Samsung 2560x1440 monitor. While it will be an upgrade in every sense, I believe the only real upgrade will be it's clean output amps from the conversion and they will improve the sound quality minimally, but having a choice today I would purchase the Sanskrit for the system instead.\n\nIt's desktop small and good looking gear, it uses close to pro equivalent electronics and features a good noise free output from any of it's three inputs. It's a big jump up from what's on your computers motherboard, but can really shine when you're feeding it good signals for it to convert and using a good playback system to have the ability to hear it's improvement in audio reproduction, this is what I proved to myself in my studio. So if you're creating a new system that you'll need a DAC for, I'll recommend this one without hesitation. Just remember that in order for you to give it a 5 star review you need to understand how it's able to improve your audio reproduction and that there will still be times that you won't hear the difference. You will need a good amp and speakers and when plugging the Sanskrit into inexpensive equipment you can only imagine being impressed. Using it with a good headphone amp and headphones will be the easiest way to hear it's improvement that it's making, because it's just like the difference when using a really good CD player vs a cheap one which is an old argument that's over, it's not about 192k/32 like advertising wants you to think, it's about it using better than cheap output amps.\n\nMy first reaction was that the Sanskrit is too expensive, but it tests out so well that I've softened on that. If you're looking for a step up from the cheap DAC's sold at 45 to $60, this is all you need at only a bit more cost, I know that I wouldn't spend any more on one for general use myself and that was my worry at just over a Benjamin. Above the price of this, you might start spending something like $250 per each 1% improvement in audio reproduction. If you do, you had better spend enough to least get some&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Low-End-Pro/dp/B00LI6S6JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Low End Pro</a>&nbsp;near field monitors or spend many thousands on the gear all setup in a quiet, conditioned room to ever hear that 5% better audio reproduction that you might achieve when listening with with trained ears. Unless you just want it to feed a good headphone amp that you already have, in which case you should like it a lot having such near perfect audio reproduction and the ability to hear that it is.\n\nYou may have already figured this out, but also take into account that I'm more of an objective listener of audio reproduction. I like authentic audio reproduction, I don't like the gear or prices or what it does to the sound, in my world it shouldn't 'do' anything. It should accurately reproduce the waveform that came from the electronics before it in the signal path, outputting it to the next amp that will legitimately duplicate the signal at a higher power level to the speakers. That's why I have no descriptive words for you about how this sounds, it's good or nice or pleasing to listen to and rates about a 9 of 10 at doing it's job that it's designed to do.\n\nTo Mark who wanted me to review the M6: This may not be the M6, but it's truly a great starting point for the headphone amp in the M6, and I'll bet that you'll like it if the price is okay with you. I originally didn't think that this Sanskrit would be worth it's cost, and now I'm a believer.","summary":"Fascinating","unixReviewTime":1455408000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_945"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710sw72RiGL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2017","reviewerID":"A7W2F6LL1Z5YQ","asin":"B00SY9RBOM","reviewerName":"Amir M.","reviewText":"This is a decent DAC with multiple digital inputs.

While our home was well-built, back then they didn't put insulation in our walls and there wasn't much in the attic, so having that done to our home has made all the difference. Even then, this camera has helped make it obvious where our home is still lacking in spots and where it isn't.\n\nConsidering the price, I'm not surprised it works so well. I would expect an excellent product at this price point, and I feel FLIR delivers. Each time you power on, it takes a moment to calibrate. Then you're ready to start shooting and viewing. This would be a particularly excellent product for someone in the home building/insulating businesses and similar industries, obviously. We are a DIY family whenever we can manage, and don't mind getting our hands dirty with home projects. As we work on making our home more energy efficient and replacing the old windows, I expect this thermal camera to be a gem of a gadget to us. We've already noticed the difference in our home's energy efficiency since the insulation was done. In that way, I think this camera could be especially helpful to those focused on creating lock tight seals and weatherproofing.\n\nIt is about the size of your average smartphone, the outer plastic has good grip and seems like it could survive a drop (though I won't test that theory), and finally has a nice long strap so you can keep it convenient and safe.

The included power supply/charger and the included plugs are not great quality and I couldn't even get the appropriate US plug end to go into the supply/charger. I charged mine from the USB cable and my computer.\n\nThe camera itself is thin and lightweight. It definitely doesn't feel like a $700 camera in your hands, although most cameras cant see heat so Ill let that slide.\n\nWhen you first turn it on, it goes through a start up but is ready to use within a minute. After the first use, it starts up within seconds. The buttons are very straightforward, an on/off button and a large save button for saving your image as a picture.\n\nI ordered the camera because we are a general construction company and many times we need to know where heat escaping or where plumbing is located. We have used and played with it to where we see what it is capable of doing and what it is not. This is the first camera of this type for us so we were new to it.\n\nThe camera easily picks up things that are outward. What I mean is if you open the cabinets, you can see the water pipes under the cabinets but you cannot see the pipes through the cabinets. The cabinet doors may look somewhat hotter where there are pipes behind them compared to ones where no pipes exist but its just a slight shading to it, no definite outlines. Because of this, you really have to train yourself in how to spot subtle differences in the camera screen. Where it really excels is the obvious light and dark areas around doors and windows, etc.\n\nIt was even eye-opening to see items like the cable box and coffee maker that were glowing bright orange in the screen even when it was not on. Remind me to unplug my appliances when not in use, I think my electric bill would really go down.\n\nIt did not show much if you are trying to spot heat spots from the outside of the home, the exterior construction is too thick. You pick up the heat that is all over the building from the sun and not individual things. It does have advantages but it is limited to what it shows. It just gives you the general area of heat many times and its up to you to find where the heat is coming from.\n\nThis camera can be really handy for contractors like us, homeowners who are wanting to spot where they might be losing heat, and for hunters, etc. who want to spot animals.","summary":"Useful But It Does Have Limitations","unixReviewTime":1437523200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_953"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HX0QblsvL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31NKOM+8MWL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"33","verified":false,"reviewTime":"07 16, 2015","reviewerID":"A2WC9NFLG57W4H","asin":"B00T9RANUC","style":{"Model Number:":" Standard","Style:":" Thermal Camera only"},"reviewerName":"Momma Mary","reviewText":"Very easy to use system that works as advertised.

I made a new extruder plate to try and prevent the binding issue, and I've been respooling the filament before printing.  This helps a lot and I was able to successfully print about 30g for an OpenRC tire.  it's still a lot more work to print, but once \"dialed in\" (which for me included printer mods and respooling filament) it does OK.\n\nIt's not as stretch as ninjaflex, but for tires it'll do fine.\n---------\nI don't care for this product.  It's very inexpensive, but so far I've got one good print (my own little benchmark for tuning this filament) and two failed ones, both because this jammed in my extruder.\n\nI am using a modified Monoprice Select Mini, maybe a direct-feed extruder will be more generous.  I print great with Ninjaflex, which is softer / more flexible, but I think the problem is that this filament is jumbled onto the spool and comes out kinked.  The kinks seem to catch in the extruder, even when I've disabled any retraction.\n\nI've been warned against using cheap filament, and this stuff definitely counts.  I was trying to print wheels for an RC car; they work well in PETG, but I was hoping this TPU would do better.  So far I can't successfully print a straight meter of this without a jam.\n\nAPART from the jamming issue, the stuff seems to be of reasonable quality.  It's definitely harder than the 85A ninjaflex, so I can't question \"95A\".  it seems about like a skateboard wheel.  It comes off very shiny, moreso than Ninjaflex.  Adhesion between layers is excellent, but I did some tuning.  It prints relatively cold, around 210, and sticks well enough to a glass bed.\n\nIf I could get this to print I think it'd do great in my application.","summary":"Kinky, jams in the extruder; otherwise fine","unixReviewTime":1483488000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_958"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81geKLGoT3L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"11 27, 2016","reviewerID":"A6F63IGF9IASD","asin":"B00TI3JUWO","style":{"Color:":" Blue"},"reviewerName":"sam","reviewText":"Haven't used any of my prints long enough to have really tested the layer bonding but so far it seems fine.

This would not feed into my extruder around 30 meters into my first spool but after checking the rest of it I'm sure it's just anomaly... I hope. Most likely I still check the entire length of future spools as well. I'm convinced this drip got on the line during manufacturing because it's shape suggests it was traveling away from the hot end against gravity.\nAll in all I'm not discouraged from this band.

Starting off, do NOT try to print this without support between the extruder and the hot end. I figured that since this was not full on flexible filament, it may do just fine if I printed it really slow. Unfortunately the filament started to bunch up between the extruder and hot end. I stayed nearby, just in case, so I caught it before it became a major issue.\n\nAfter a little digging on the Robo forums, I discovered that a pen's ink tube could be used in a pinch. Some others suggested some small brass pipes, and others suggested PTFE tube. No matter which, I highly recommend having some method to fill the gap. I also printed quite slowly, and around 240C for the temperature.\n\nI printed a small vase, which came out pretty nice. It wasn't amazing visually, but it was cool to have something that could be squashed, and spring back. It also took quite a while to print, compared to some of the other items that I printed. Really, that is what I expected, so it isn't that big an issue. I also printed a gasket, which worked out quite nicely.\n\nSomething you should keep in mind is that this is Semi-flex filament. This is not stretchy, it simply is flexible. Which definitely has its uses. It did just what I wanted it to do. After trying this out, I am looking forward to trying fully flexible filament.\n\nWhy didn't I give 5 stars? Well, I can't say that I love this filament. I definitely like it, and will keep using it. If you are looking to try semi-flex, then I highly recommend getting this filament. I just don't currently plan to use it too much, since it is a bit of a hassle to use it right now. The ink tube works, but I would really like to upgrade my printer so that it can use this filament without any trouble.\nIf you want to try it, then research ways to make it play nice with your printer. Well, unless you already have a printer that can use this already. Either way, if you can, I would recommend trying this filament.\n\nA little extra Info, I use a Robo 3D R1+. It can be made able to use this filament, it just requires minor modifications.

You actually have to do the opposite of every other filament and put something in between the bed and the print to make it *easier* to get the stuff off. I've been using a spray on cooking oil. Spray the bed and wipe it down with a paper towel so that you have a thin layer of oil coating your PEI. Your print will peel off without a nightmare of scraping or damage to the bed. Cleaning the oil off so that all your other prints don't slip off is another issue altogether. :-)\n\nI bought the blue and gray versions on this filament.

I just received this model and I am very pleased with the build quality and ease of use.  The internal frame is extruded aluminum rail and the unit is sturdy and quiet when building.  It has an SD card slot for building directly from files, and As for the first reviewer, it looks like the Z height was not adjusted properly at the factory - mine wasn't either.  The starting position was too close to the build plate causing a jammed extruder.  So I'd highly recommend you check this first - as it is, the Z height offset can be set but the menu doesn't provide a way to move the Z axis to the bed to check the gap. It was obvious from the start that it was too low - the painters tape was getting ripped off the glass!  So I stopped the print and immediately raised the offset - it took two tries, but I finally got it working.  BTW my set at the factory offset was .9mm but the working number for mine was 2.2mm.  Also, mine needed a firmware update fresh out of the box.\n\nIt took no more than 15 minutes from box to first print, even given the Z offset problem.  The filament autoloading process was easy.  The extruder does have an all-metal hot end, so while it could do ABS the bed is not heated.  Perhaps a future model will add these things, but at $349 this is an exceptional unit for a teenager or student looking to own their first machine and get in to 3D printing.  The client software, while better than when first released with the DaVinci 1.0, is still kinda ugly and slow for slicing.  It does work and there are alternatives, though they are not free.\n\nSo why not 5 stars?  Well, I'd like to see a heated bed even in this size.  I wish the client software would be more developed and not so utilitarian.  And the Z offset was clearly wrong out of the box.  Even so, these are tolerable for the price.\n\nA more complete review will appear on my additive manufacturing blog soon at www.renaissance-engineer.net","summary":"Great value in a PLA-only machine!","unixReviewTime":1431043200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_978"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71siIIm4wrL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QWtAuOK0L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R7VqFvW2L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IhGRLTDZL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qPKrhjkBL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IQH8oF7AL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tMETFXQqL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JMAbcw5-L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610clOg9AtL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P00HtCdBL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qPKrhjkBL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"12 27, 2017","reviewerID":"A3QV6G3CW1D1D9","asin":"B00V3J8JEG","style":{"Color:":" Original"},"reviewerName":"SNIPER-MAX","reviewText":"I considered cheaper units before purchasing this unit.

This has been the 2nd 3D printer that I have ordered through Amazon in the last couple of months. My goal is to produce some toys for my grandchildren for Christmas. The 1st 3D printer came as a RepRap kit which I assembled. However, I am still trying to get it to work. Hence, I ordered the XYZ Printer Junior.\n\nI will simply describe the chain of events, since I am sure that many people go through exactly the same process.\n\nI un-boxed the XYZ Junior and had it printing a couple of hours later. A few minutes after that, I had my 1st successful 3D print. The 2nd 3D print was printed overnight and took 13 hours to print. I'll get back to those prints in a minute.\n\nThe instructions say to connect to your computer and install the software, which is on a micro-SD card, which comes with an adapter for a full size SD card. This card should work in most computers. I found it best to copy the software onto my hard drive and install the software from there. My security software blocked it from installing from the memory card.\n\nThere are only versions of the XYZ software for Windows and the MAC. But not for Linux operating system. (I have one computer that uses Mint Linux.)\n\nI installed the software on a Netbook which is using Windows 7, but could not get the software to run successfully on that computer. The netbook has limited memory and has a slower clock speed. So I installed the software on my main full-size notebook computer, which has expanded memory and an expanded hard drive. I connected the printer to my main computer and the software installed fine on it. At least, it did up to the point where it downloaded an updated version of itself. In updating, it also updated the firmware of the printer. My security software objected and the Update froze up. I later updated the software on my computer without the printer attached. The printer seems to work fine afterwards.\n\nThe software gives you the option of watching demonstration videos online. Regardless of having watched them before, it's a good idea to watch them with the printer in front of you and going through the motions with the videos. I had previously watched the videos, and I still learned some new things while watching the videos with the printer in front of me.\n\nOne thing that caught my attention was the amount of filament that you get with each spool. I compared the filament spools for this printer with the spools my other 3d Printer (The one that I have not gotten to work yet) and the special filament spools for the XYZ Printer Junior are a lot smaller.  The Junior only uses PLA filaments.\n\nOK. Now I made 2 prints with the Junior. I simply downloaded a couple of objects from the Thingiverse.com website, and ran them through the XYZ software. Then saved them to a memory card in the XYZ file format. After that, I placed the memory card in the XYZ Printer and choose which one to print out. The printer does the rest. Nice and neat.\n\nThe 1st was the penguin in the photos. Not as detailed as I expected, but it was also a lot smaller then I expected.\n\nThe 2nd item was the mug. It turned out to be a lot larger then I expected. And I ran into an unexpected problem with using the mug afterwards. I filled it with a carbonated drink and let it sit on my table for about an hour. After awhile, I noticed that the color of the liquid drink was spreading into the color of the mug. The mug had been printed with a translucent white. As I watched, I realized that the liquid was seeping into the cell structure of the mug and the bottom was becoming moist. It also seemed as if the plastic was softening up. This may relate to the nature of the PLA plastic, I don't know. And this problem could probably be cured with some sort of coating. Again, I don't know.\n\nFinal: This printer was pleasure to setup and use, compared to the kit printer that I had previously purchased. But the XYZ Junior is going to cost far more to use on a day-by-day bases. Plus the issue of the plastic material becoming mildly porous has me questioning the idea behind this technology.\n\nAll in all, this printer is easy to setup and start printing with, and is fine for casual printing. Anyone should be able to set this printer up and be printing 3D objects shortly after opening the box. But you need a different printer if you plan on printing things every day.\n\nUpdate Nov. 11, 2015\nI've had the printer for a few days. I can honestly say that it's a please to use. Run your object .sti file through the XYZ software, save the resulting .3w file format to a memory card, put the card in the printer and print it out.\n\nBut it's no speed demon. I am uploading a photo of a coaster that I printed out. Each coaster too nearly 3 hours to print. I printed out a set of them. It's easy to get carried away in printing things with it. I am also uploading a photo of one of the coasters I sitting under one of my mugs to show comparative size. I either downloaded the sti file from the XYZ gallery or thingiverse.com. Not sure which location that the file came from. Both have an extensive galleries of files.\n\nWhen printing things. it's good to be around the printer when it is finishing up printing your object. The LCD shows a countdown until the object being printed is completed. If you remove the item just after it is finished, then you object is easy to remove from the base. But if you wait awhile until it cools down, then it becomes very difficult to remove your printed project from the glass plate. (I discovered this the hard way when I let it print a project over night. I figured that it would be ready for me when I woke up in the morning. It was, but I had to remove the paper from the glass to get it off without breaking the glass.)\n\nSpeaking of the glass base plate. It is covered with a peel-&-stick paper from XYZ. It is also expensive, running about $1 per sheet. 3rd parties sell similar peel-&-stick paper for about the same price. The paper can be reused for additional projects up until you removed it from the glass or it becomes torn. I plan on experimenting with alternatives. The paper appears to simply be a special sized sheet of masking tape.\n\nOne other thing to watch out for. The vents to this printer are on the back. If you are like me and planning on setting up the printer up on a cabinet located against the wall, then you will have to leave some room between the printer cabinet and the wall so that air can flow through the cabinet. (I am also uploading a photo of the vents on the back of it.)\n\nNo doubt about it, this thing is addictive. I am finding all kinds of things fir it to print. But this printer could also end up being expensive too.\n\nUpdate December 23, 2015\nThe printer has not been working for about 3 weeks now. Suddenly the prints started to fail. After a lot of time trying to check it out, it seems that heating element was no longer getting hot enough. This resulted in a clogged nozzle and barrel. Nor would filament go through the nozzle afterwards.\n\nAfter multiple phone calls and messages with customer support, (with Customer Support saying that parts were on  the way to me, then amending that to say that the parts were not on the way) it is starting to look as if my printer will be out of commission for 2 months, at the earliest. And that is only if they actually send me a replacement part. (Something that I am skeptical about now.)\n\nSo I have a 1 star opinion of the XYZ Printing Customer Support right now.\nMy opinion has dropped from 5 stars to 1 star.\n\nUpdate: October 19, 2016\n\nI sent the bad Print Head in to XYA for repairs on Dec 28th. About 6 weeks after sending in the bad print head, XYZ sent me a new replacement print head.

Here I found out that filament was not even feeding filament through the tube.\n\nI then pulled the extruder off and replaced the filament extruder motor. This did not help.\n\nXYZ asked me to ship the printer back to them for repair, at my own expense.

If you have a case you will have to get an extension for another $20. FLIR could have done a much better design by having an extended lightning connector with an adjustable bracket to keep the camera tight up against the phone. This was very disappointing. Until I get the adapter, which is very small and likely to get lost and cost even more money to replace, I have to take the case off my phone every time. FLIR could have added on an extension with an tether to keep the extension from getting lost. It's clear that the engineers tested this in a lab and not in the real world. Engineers need to get out more often and experience real life.\n\nI realize that a longer connector is subject to damage from having more leverage on it but they could have come up with a much better solution that they way it is. An extension will cause the same damage and leverage. To me, it might have been better to use the stereo plug but that may have not had enough ports to make this work. Or to use both ports that would have given it more stability.\n\nThe images are marginal even in room light. Resolution is very low and while it does okay for some situations it will not work well in the dark. That is a huge problem because to get accurate images in some cases there can't be any other IR radiation. I took some images of my house when it was pitch black and the image was so bad that it was almost unusable. It was just a blur around warmer spots.\n\nIf one were to take an image of a house, to look for heat escaping, in the sun it would show lots of heat escaping from the roof. That's because the sun is heating up the roof and in reality there may be very little heat escaping from the roof.\n\nIt did show some areas were the contractor didn't insulate a few areas and he will be coming back to fix that problem on his dime. I am also calling the city to complain about the inspector because he signed it off that the insulation was installed and installed correctly. So that is a benefit.\n\nI did find several areas that I need to add a few pipes for my floor heating which is why I got this in the first place. The spacing between pipes is too much and I will add a third pipe to get more consistency in floor temperatures.\n\nI am struggling to decide if I should keep this or not.

Most of you are aware that PLA has a hard time sticking on bare 3D print beds; be it may aluminum, acrylic, glass, etc. What happens is that somewhere along the printing process, the objects either warp or slide off completely, causing a failed or ugly result. Many solutions surfaced over time to attempt at solving this, including using 3M painters tape / sheets, heated beds, slurries, glues, etc., and of course these Dremel Build Sheets.\n\nNow by themselves, these sheets are just OK. A brand new sheet sticks well like 3M painter's tape, but unlike the 3M tape, these sheets last for about 20 to 30 large prints instead of 1 or 2 prints with the 3M tape. After that, the prints start warping or sliding off, and it's time to change the sheet. Right now you might be wondering, \"how on earth is this worth $30?\" I'll get there, please read on...\n\nSo the trick is that before each print, you must level your print bed, and then rub 2-3 thin coats of Elmer's School Glue Stick on the surface of the Dremel Build Sheet (until it's pale white). Now I don't know what the chemistry is behind this, but something amazing happens... Not only do the prints stick 100% to the surface with perfectly straight non-warped results, but you can do this again and again and again using the same sheet! I printed out big 5x5\" objects with the Dremel Idea Builder printer OVER 200 TIMES using the SAME SHEET! All you have to do is wash off the glue after every print, and repeat the process. Not even my heated bed Robo3D printer gave me this kind of performance; not even close! Note, you'll need to use some kind of thin spatula, or whack your object on a hard surface, because these babies will stick like a weld if you use this trick!\n\nSo TL;DR - The trick is before every print, level your bed and then apply 2-3 coats of Elmer's School Glue Stick on the Dremel Build Sheet; Wash off the glue after each print; repeat; Will last for 100s of prints.","summary":"BETTER than \"heated beds\" for PLA prints, MUCH CHEAPER than 3M painters tape!

I've built Printrbots in the past and like how economical they are.  However I experienced some issues with the Play 1505 Assembled.  Some of these may be Amazon's fault but most I believe are Printrbot's.\n\n1.  Printer came without any power adapter or any other accessory listed in the BOM (power adapter, usb, delran spacer, test print) except the spool holder.  I contacted Printrbot and they got right back to me with an apology and immediately shipped the power adapter on same day.\n\n2.  Printer is pre-assembled but it was not properly built.  The 1/4\" acme coupler to the Z axis was installed way too high on the drive shaft.  The extruder could never get close the print bed because the X axis switch was hitting the acme coupler.  (This might explains why there was no 'test' print that the BOM said was included with pre-assembled Printrbot Play's).\n\n3.  The auto-leveling probe was supposed to be set properly.  The probe was set way too low and I eventually had to re-adjust it (no biggie).\n\n4.  The printer I received from Amazon appears to be an \"older\" model.  The directions for removing the fan guard to adjust the auto-leveling probe showed thumb screws but the screws on the fan guard are hex heads.  The direction states that some of the older printers did not have thumbscrews but hex screws.\n\n5.  The wiring for the extruder hangs down in such a way as to interfere with the print bed when the y-axis is moving.  I will need to adjust the wiring.\n\n6.  Sometimes the X axis doesn't seem to recognize when it moves to the home position.  It will start to grind trying to push the X-axis home switch.\n\nThe good news is I am able to get a decent print after resolving most of the issue above (see photos).  I luckily had a spare power adapter (12V/6A) from my other Printrbot so I could get right to printing.  Printrbot sent me an email within a short period of time telling me they will ship me a new one.\n\nI've built both the Printrbot Simple 2014 and the Simple Metal before (both very good economic printers).  I ordered the Play assembled simply because of a lack of time (and I've done it before).\n\nSo it wasn't that I could not fix these problems but I think some of these would confuse (and upset) someone who expected it to be fully functional out of the box.  Especially the lack of a power supply that's just flat out wrong.\n\nIf this printer works well I'll up the review to 4 stars and update my experiences with printing.","summary":"Some Issues","unixReviewTime":1438732800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1006"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NCy240ycL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710KfNMV4KL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cLA5SoEgL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":1,"vote":"3","verified":false,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2016","reviewerID":"A2URQW61GZ9VTV","asin":"B00WLK4Z4Y","style":{"Color:":" White","Style:":" Assembled"},"reviewerName":"tr2v3l3r","reviewText":"I have purchased at least 10 printrbot printers in the past, and I currently own 8 Printrbot printers.  I have purchased Play becuase I can easily move it around.  I got 2 printers - both assembled.  I was going to cut down on assembly time.  Both of the printers weren't assembled properly and required tinkering to get them going.  On the first printer, the wires weren't installed properly, so Z axis was stuck at 100mm, instead of 130.  I needed to cut zip ties, and then I was able to get the printer to work - goes up to 130mm (makes angry noises when it gets close to the 125mm mark).  On a second printer, hot end wasn't heating up - I checked and the wire was broken.  I removed the bad wire and replaced it with a new one.  Had to solder the wire to the connector.  Decided to replace the entire wire in case there are more breaks.  At least 2 hours of time wasted instead of 15 minutes it should take you to print on a brand new printer.  Complained to Help Desk, and got banned by Help Desk, because I logged a lot of issues in the past (20+ issues in 2.5 years).  Contacted Brook and he confirmed that Help Desk decision is right.  Avoid buying this printer if you are a first time user.  You will get frustrated, and your printer will sit untouched.\n\nOtherwise I like Printrbot printers because you can buy upgrades.  Installed Y upgrade with heated bed on my simple.  I was able to print ABS, and PLA, and didn't have any issues with getting filament to stick to the printbed.

At first i feared it, now I'm mesmerized by its possibilities.\n\nI have a huge, heavy neon sign transformer  (NST) that puts out 5000 volts (5kV) at 18 milliamps (0.018A) and this little box puts out a much scarier spark, although the this doesn't seem to travel through stiff wires so I couldn't make a mini Jacob's Ladder out of it (yet). I'm thinking that means it has very low amps...I haven't measured it yet (use a high voltage divider probe or else you'll wreck your multimeter).\n\nOne side has 2 white (or red) wires: those are your outputs. Mine has 2 white outputs.\n\nThe input side will have two DIFFERENT color wires (1 red and 1 white). You have to hook positive input to the red. Hook negative input to the white.\n\nIn my photo the tips of the output wires are exactly 1/4\" apart. The input voltage was 3.3 volts DC. The spark was loud, blue and awesome!

You probably shouldn't go over 4 volts or so, although I did momentarily and got a huge spark. The specs say 3 volts. I needed 3.4 to get a steady spark. I'll update if I blow it up and I'll include the final voltage.\n\nIf you have the wires farther than 1/4\" then either it won't spark or you'll crank up the voltage really high to get a spark: either way you might destroy this device.\n\nIf you apply voltage and don't provide an escape for it (a spark or powering something) you can destroy this unit. That's another danger of trying to make a bigger spark gap: you'll be powering this unit but if there's no spark you can destroy this unit apparently.

The metal loop that locks the nozzle in the open position works well, and it has a good feel overall.\n\nThe only negative is that I had to use some thread sealing tape (not sure that \"plumbers tape\" is actually the correct term) to keep the nozzle-to-hose connection from leaking.  That seems to be a common problem, and its a pain, but at least its easily remedied.\n\nIve got other nozzles that have some spray patterns that are either almost redundant or not very useful, but with this nozzle the patterns are varied, useful, and don't dribble or otherwise not work properly.

My roll seemed a little weird for PLA - it liked higher temps, I needed to dial down retraction, I needed to keep the bed at 60* the whole print. Once I dialed in the settings of .5 mm retraction, 215c for the whole print, and the bed at 60c - it prints great. It's strong, stringing is low, and the prints come out remarkably clean and shiny. It really is a great value for the money.\n\nIt does have a bit of an ABS odor to it when it prints, and other people review it say it's not PLA. One look at this small label and mystery solved \"PLA+\". This is allegedly the same material as eSun's PLA Pro. It's a slightly different blend of materials than regular PLA. It generally has improved characteristics. In so far as I can tell, it's melting point is a little higher, and it's \"globbier\", which assuredly gives it better layer adhesion but means its a little more sensitive to under extrusion and retraction.\n\nNow that I have the settings dialed in, it is a great filament at a very low price - however, I'm obligated to knock off a star since I didn't get the material I expected. The main label just says PLA - but it isn't like my particular roll is just mislabeled, as it indicates print temperature of 205-225c - the same print temps as eSun's PLA Pro. For regular black PLA, eSun indicates standard print temps of 190-220c.\n\nAllegedly, Inland (Microcenter store brand) filament is OEM'ed by eSun - so the temperatures lining up here seems to corroborate that.\n\nIt wasn't until I noticed this little + sign on this little label that I realized what was going on. It's just better filament than they said it is. Tweak your settings accordingly and prepare to be pretty impressed with the quality for the price. I'll be buying more and hoping I get the PLA Pro.","summary":"It's good stuff: But check your label - I received PLA+ aka PLA Pro - NEED DIFFERENT SETTINGS","unixReviewTime":1515888000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1027"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qDgKfEwEL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":3,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"04 13, 2017","reviewerID":"A1CC9CXKTVLS46","asin":"B00YQB85PG","reviewerName":"ReyVn Cheshirefox","reviewText":"Like most inexpensive filaments, it works for some things but not others.  I've had several rolls of Inland PLA (they are using PLA+ now despite the item title) in several colors and they all perform pretty much the same.  Don't expect it to work for quick low resolution prints - across every roll of PLA from Inland that I've tried, it performs between horrible at greater than .2mm layer height to acceptable but poor at .18mm - that said, if you can get your printer down to .04 to .1mm layer height, and can stand waiting, you're in for an excellent print with great adhesion and consistent layer quality.  The \"sweet spot\" for speed vs resolution seems to be around .15mm for a layer height.  Inexpensive filaments have their place in prototyping, but this one doesn't cut it for fast prototyping.  If that is what you need, you'll actually save time=money by budgeting for a higher level filament.  If budget is your biggest concern, print slower and higher resolution and you will achieve good results.","summary":"Like most inexpensive filaments","unixReviewTime":1492041600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1028"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PKQ4A7TzL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71b-KM4WcfL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711-xPFS3FL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7127MQM36wL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JXkPoU8SL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"03 16, 2017","reviewerID":"A2CLRDCMTTBNWB","asin":"B00YQB85PG","reviewerName":"Riskable","reviewText":"This is an excellent filament and the price is awesome (paid about $17).

Thus, I still need do dial my machine in more for perfect prints. But this is looking good. I have attached some images, the prints aren't perfect but are suitable for my needs, none of the issues I faced while printing these models were the fault of the filament. The dragon skull was the first print with this filament straight out of the box. No adjustments made from the previous filament which was Hatchbox black.\n\nI will say that this filament once printed feels nice in your hand, I mean its just PLA but it is almost a matte or satin feel instead of the high gloss filaments.

It would be nice if it did, but it is just not the case. So to get around this, you need to put the smallest possible piece of tubing on your wires. It should be a snug fit, before shrunk.\n\nBecause of the lower quality of the tubing, using a lighter is also not recommended. Use a heat gun if possible, and hold it further away then you might normally, or else the tubing will burn before it shrinks.\n\nHonestly that's about it for this tubing.

The neck being a smaller diameter, this left a paper then layer of metal to support the top of the neck (notice the bore in the picture goes right to the neck where it broke). The second, which was probably exacerbated by the 1st condition, is that it arrived slightly bent at that weak point (likely during shipping). I only hope I can get the broken tube out of the heat sink so it isn't a complete loss. I highly recommend that 3D CAM shorten the bore to e3d spec, and maybe add a shipping support collar to the heat block so it doesn't get bent during shipment. This would have been 5 stars without the heat break issue, as I really liked the rest of the product.\n\nORIGINAL:\nI did an analysis of the item I received vs. the e3d specs for the V6 hotend as soon as the package arrived. Overall, I am very happy so far with the construction. A few improvements, and it would be perfect. I haven't printed with this unit yet, but will update my review with performance stats once I get some prints done. Here is what I found:\n\nThe item I received is indeed modeled after the V6. Below is an analysis of the quality vs.the e3d:\n* The heater cartridge is clamped in with an M3 screw instead of just using a set screw. E3d did this to improve heat transfer.\n* The thermistor is embedded in the heat block and also clamped with an M3 screw. However, there is no washer included that would cover the hole (part of the e3d spec), though I don't see the thermistor falling out easily. Also, the thermistor uses PTFE insulation instead of the stronger braiding, so the clamp screw could short the thermistor out if tightened too much. I will change the insulation as a precaution.\n* The nozzle matches the v6, having 2 transitions of narrowing instead of one, which is a great improvement due to less required nozzle pressure. Haven't had a chance to check internal finish, but I can  say the hole is round and centered.\n* The heat break had some major issues, which prevented a 5 star rating. My heat break came slightly bent at the thinner neck area, probably due to bring shipped fully assembled in a soft pouch. I very carefully corrected by bending with a nail, but am unsure of the strength now (well, it just broke...). The heat break matches some of the design of the V6, but the PTFE liner is allowed to move all the way down near the cold/hot boundary instead of just a few mm like the V6. It's still in the cold end, so we will see.\n* The heat sink is well machined and the shroud and fan were tight and straight. I haven't powered up the fan yet to test.\n* Threads in the heat sink appear to be decently cut. They are a little on the loose side, so I will put thermal paste in to allow better heat transfer.\n* All wires were neatly attached and fastened together with kapton tape.\n* Hydraulic clamp for PTFE liner was nice and snug.\n\nIn summary, here are the areas that could be modded to bring this very close to e3D quality:\n* Braided fiberglass insulator added to thermistor wires where screw clamps it down to prevent short.\n* Add washer to thermistor clamp screw to cover the hole and keep it nice and tight in there where it will get a better reading.\n* Just buy a new heat break for 5-10 dollars to be safe if yours is bent. I did.","summary":"Item I received appears to be well built, heat break needs to be improved.","unixReviewTime":1474588800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1094"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DGNulaG+L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GdA3kYE9L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kCvn41m2L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JxjKeF23L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lJOG+GzhL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"5","verified":true,"reviewTime":"03 16, 2017","reviewerID":"A2CLRDCMTTBNWB","asin":"B010Y25PQC","reviewerName":"Riskable","reviewText":"eSun \"Green\" is awesome!

Ever since there I have been doing some research on how to create a custom 3d printer. This led me to this product. I was looking for a cheap but working arduino mega with a ramps. Because of the low price for what is provided in this kit I decided to try this one out. The components for this kit came in nice anti static bags and also the pins were placed in foam blocks to protect them. But it seems that they did not work as intended, the pins on the boards were slightly bent so I needed to take time to strengthen most of them. Also the anti static bags were also punctured during the shipping process. But this what I expected for the price that I payed.\n\nBesides the bent pins on the board the soldering job on my boards were a little sloppy but there were no misconnections. Assembling the boards together were easy after fixing the pins. I installed Marlin on the arduino mega and it works perfectly. I have used the boards for my 3d printer for 2 months and so far haven't had any problems. Over all this kit is very useful for building a 3d printer although it might be cheaper in the long run to buy a full kit such like a Prusa i3 that go for around $200 at the time of my review. This is because you will need to add in the cost of the power brick, stepper motors, linear rods and so on.\n\nI truly like this kit since its a good value for what you get. But if you are planing to make your own custom 3d printer I would highly recommend you buy a cheap mass produced 3d printer kits since there are around $200 and use the parts to make your own design. Even if you don't complete your custom printer design you can still make the intended 3d printer.\n\n[Pros]\n1. Nicely packed (They used anti static bags for all the parts.)\n2. Everything works (Tested for around 2 months)\n3. Marlin works on the board.\n\n[Cons]\n1. Anti static bags were punctured when I received them.\n2.

Most 3D pens use a solid plastic filament, melt it, then squirt it out, just like most 3D printers. This pen uses a reservoir of a very thick \"ink\" that is really a UV cured resin. This is a nice idea because nothing has to get hot and make it horribly unsafe for children. I was able to create some crude 3D drawings with a little practice. It definitely takes some getting used to. The \"ink\" cured nicely and was pretty plastic like and brittle when cured. Following the directions helps prevent nozzle clogs. A few things of note:\n\nThe Good:\n* No heat required\n* Can quickly get going\n* Fun and safe for all ages\n\nThe Bad:\n* Refills are not currently available and the price is unknown\n* The resin remains very slightly sticky after cured.\n\nThe Ugly:\n* It is designed rather cheaply, but the loading/unloading of ink cartridges could have been much improved with small modifications to the retention mechanism. Attention to detail please!\n* If you use the pen on a reflective surface, the intense UV will quickly get to your eyes and bother them. Not sure how safe that is.\n\nFor the price, if you're interested, give it a whirl, but don't expect a long term supported product.","summary":"Interesting Idea - A Beta for Early Adopters and the Curious","unixReviewTime":1453766400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1105"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Bf9JTqayL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"01 15, 2016","reviewerID":"A35HOUWHAYZZN6","asin":"B011KVYLUW","reviewerName":"Hedera Femme","reviewText":"This is fun!

I chose RepRapGuru's kit since their reviews looked good and they are a USA manufacturer, and their website seems good, they have documentation, firmware download and forums. It's the first time I've actually tried to print on a 3D printer and I had no clue what it would take. After I finished assembling it, understanding how the technology works and doing all the calibration, I was able to print some cubes, which to me look pretty fine.\n\nDocumentation:\nTheir website contains all you need to assemble and program your printer. They provide two documents, assembly and programming/calibration, plus a zip with the firmware and a zip with the Repetier and Slic3r program. All the documentation seems to be kept up to date, there were some comments on some steps saying what things might be different on newer kits, which happened to be the case on mine. The instructions include high-res pictures and detailed explanations, really helped this newbie to put everything together.\n\nCustomer Support:\nRight after I placed my order I received an email warning me about some printer kits that left their warehouse with a missing manufacturing step on the smooth rods that caused rust, telling me that if this was the case, to contact them. My kit was one of those and I emailed them and immediately they shipped the new rods, 2-days shipping at no cost. The new ones arrived in perfect conditions. I really appreciate their honesty and giving me the heads up, you can tell they really care about customers.\n\nI also emailed them about an issue I had with Y axis skipping in the middle of my prints, they replied a few hours after I sent my email (on a Sunday!) and suggested to verify the tension on the belt, which I thought I did, but I tightened more and now it's printing perfectly.\n\nPackaging:\nThe main box came with a lot of padding and inside there were smaller boxes with more padding. I was worried about the glass bed and the acrylic frame breaking during shipping, but everything was in perfect condition, no cracks or broken pieces. Every part came in it's own bag, numbered and labeled according to the instructions manual on their website, which made it really easy to identify the parts for each step. All the electronic parts came in anti-static bags. They even include a bag of extra screws/nuts/washers, and there are some extra parts (1 extra stepper driver, 2 extra ball bearings).\n\nIssues:\nI only had 2 issues during my build. The rods for the X axis wouldn't go in all the way on the holes on the carriage, I read that someone else had the same issue and decided to cut the rods, but I was able to identify that the issue was not the hole's depth, which was more than enough, but with some extra plastic in the whole that prevented the rod to go all the way in. I shaved it a bit with a drill bit and was able to get them to the proper depth. The other issue was with the Arduino Mega, the socket that goes from pin 14 to 21 was soldered incorrectly, shifted by 1 pin, so it started on 15 and ended up in the screw hole, but it is not the first time I've seen this happen on an Arduino clone board, and nothing a soldering iron couldn't fix. To me these 2 issues are minor and not enough to take a star off my review, and it's all part of the DIY experience.\n\nRecommendations:\nAs someone else recommended here and on their forums, I swapped the Y end stop switch and put it on the left side of the frame since it sits too close to the front right bed leveling screw. I also had the issue they mentioned with one of the screws that holds the ball joints on the bed was hitting the back of the frame, I just added some of the extra washers on the top of that screw and problem solved.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall this is a really good printer, especially for the price and a USA backing manufacturer. It looks really nice, just love the black acrylic finish. Since this is new to me, for validation I just showed my first prints to some colleagues that have been printing for a while and they said overall the quality was really good, especially for being my first prints.","summary":"My first 3D printer and I love it.

I have an engineering/machining background.  I also have experience in 3D printing due to a course i had in college.  Our machines were much higher-end machines (Stratasys and OBJET) so i knew about file formats and slicing. This is my first experience however with a consumer grade machine and i am deeply enjoying a challenge.\n\nThe Problems:\nWhen i first received the package, i took an inventory and i found nothing was missing.  I did find one of the support legs of the main frame had a chip out of the plexiglass.  Quick email to support@reprapguru.com and the part is on its way.  These things happen and i am more than satisfied with how it was handled.\n\nAnother problem i had was when i plugged in the Ramps 1.4 board, the Arduino would shut off and would send an alert to my computer that it was drawing too much power.  I double checked that my limit switches were oriented correctly (Manual makes this perfectly clear you can destroy a voltage regulator on the Arduino Mega if you have them backward.)  I located the problem on one of the switches itself.  The switch had a solder bridge on it so it was shorting two pins together.  Thankfully my board wasn't destroyed.\n\nFinally, i wish the printer came with tech-flex so that we can tame the medusa of wires after all the connections are made.\n\nThe good:\nThis machine is infinitely adaptable and if you understand the process... quite capable of excellent print quality.  I bought it hoping it wouldn't require too much tweaking (i don't like unnecessary tweaking) but understand it is a necessary evil sometimes.  This machine has brought it to a manageable level.  If you have no desire to troubleshoot or find it hard to think critically to why a problem has arisen, maybe try another machine.  If you follow the directions though, you will be very close to what you need to get up and running.  I am very glad i purchased this machine vs. a davinci jr.\n\nSetup:\nIt took me about 8 hours total from unboxing to printing.  Again i am an engineer who understands how limit switches, controllers, and stepper motors interface.  The instructions are thorough enough for a beginner, just don't be in a rush or get frustrated if you have a couple quirks to work out.  I will be buying another if i find i need more machine capacity.\n\nUpdate: 5/13/16\nThis review was done of my own free will to help others make decisions on going with this seller and printer.  I did receive a roll of Black PLA after it was written from the company.","summary":"Glad i bought this vs. Davinci Jr.","unixReviewTime":1462492800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1111"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jq9L3ZA7L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":3,"vote":"6","verified":true,"reviewTime":"11 12, 2016","reviewerID":"A1JSIHT5AG4WUK","asin":"B011TS400W","style":{"Size:":" 8\" (200mm)"},"reviewerName":"DancingEva","reviewText":"Works perfect!

Yea - I use a lot of the stuff.\n\nThe obvious comparison for T-Rex tape would be Gorilla tape.  Apart from the fact that they both have annoying commercials, they are the same thickness and extra thick design.  I'd say both T-Rex and Gorilla are identical thicknesses.  The adhesive on the T-Rex does seem more grippy, and the material a little stronger. Gorilla tape has a slightly rubbery feel to the surface, while T-Rex is slick. T-Rex is also gray. The tape color is very close to the adhesive color.\n\nThe tape sticks and grabs very well, and because it's so strong and thick, it can take a lot more tension and tugging than regular duct tape.  Burnishing the tape (applying back and forth pressure to it - an old spoon works great) really makes it stick, even to wood.  As with any duct tape, it can rip when you tear it at the edge.  You really don't want to use scissors - the adhesive will stick to most blades.\n\nI'd say this is a step up from Gorilla tape, and Gorilla tape is many steps up from regular duct tape.","summary":"A step up from Gorilla Tape.

This little valve works perfectly.\n\nThe valve itself needs a 5/8\" hole through which the mounting shaft fits. I drilled the hole easily with a step drill similar to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Vastar-Titanium-Step-Drill-Cone-Drill-Bits-High-Speed-Steel-10-Steps-1-4-34-to-1-3-8-34/dp/B073JM4D8F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Vastar Titanium Step Drill Cone Drill Bits, High Speed Steel 10 Steps 1/4\" to 1-3/8\"</a>. They work great when cutting holes in thin plastic as they gradually cut the hole with very little stress on the plastic.\n\nYou tighten the valve body into place with a plastic nut that compresses a silicon washer on the inside and a hard plastic washer on the outside.\n\nThis leaves a threaded hole exposed in the valve. After wrapping a generous length of teflon tape over the fine threads of the 90-degree elbow (I had to do this three times, increasing the teflon each time until the threads no longer leaked) you screw the elbow into the valve body. I stopped when the elbow faced rearward.\n\nAt this point you can insert standard 1/4\" polyethylene tubing into the elbow until it reaches its stop. If you need to adapt to 3/8\" tubing, you'll still need a short length of 1/4\" tubing to use the included 1/4\" to 3/8\" adapter/coupling. I didn't need that. You really only need 1/4\" tubing to feed the tank as you're only replenishing the 10 ounces of water used to make a single cup of coffee after each brewing. A trickle is all you need. But the valve refills the tank almost immediately.\n\nI'd highly recommend having a main valve further down the line before the float valve. This allows you to turn the water off if you need to clean or decalcify the coffee maker or otherwise stop the water flow. I had already installed a $6.43 plastic 1/4\" to 1/4\" ball valve&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/John-Guest-PPSV040808WP-Single-Straight-Shut-Off-Valve-1-4-34-Tube-OD-x-1-4-34/dp/B003YKF2E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">John Guest PPSV040808WP Single Straight Shut-Off Valve, 1/4\" Tube OD x 1/4\"</a>&nbsp;for an earlier coffee maker that I had plumbed with a different float valve. The water comes from our reverse osmosis system that supplies water to the sink and refrigerator icemaker.\n\nThis valve works well because as you can see from the pictures, the valve has to come through the top of the tank lid. This means the float arm needs to articulate. A stainless screw allows the plastic knee joint to adjust the float to suit the desired water level.\n\nThe float fits easily inside my particular Keurig with about 1/2\" to spare on either side of the float as it rides up and down on the water surface. The indicated dimensions of 45mm diameter x 74mm long appear to be accurate.\n\nI did put a piece of Scotch tape on the lid to hold the lid onto the tank. If someone were to remove the lid, it would bring the valve out with it, the float would lower and water would start flowing. Best to lock the lid onto the tank with a piece of tape.\n\nMy previous mini-float valve worked flawlessly for more than ten years. I only retired it because the coffeemaker failed and its design called for a float that mounted on the back of the tank. This valve has to come in from the top. The valves are very simple with no parts to corrode. I hope to get the same service from this valve.","summary":"Perfect For Plumbing a Keurig Coffeemaker Water Tank","unixReviewTime":1506988800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1117"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716zSZbrPRL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hTwbIiDBL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8155uyUk9UL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"3","verified":true,"reviewTime":"05 24, 2017","reviewerID":"A10LLZMA75D4I4","asin":"B012ULUSQW","reviewerName":"Scott","reviewText":"The Esun petg prints fairly well.

They are not easy to find as few places sell them and if they do their stock is very limited. And they cost far more than they should, in the range of ten bucks for a small size. But the worst part is they only stay sticky for so long and then they become useless.\n\nSo when I saw this as a featured item I figured why not, one roll is about the same as only one waffle pad.

Hopefully, this next one will be higher quality.","summary":"Very Poor Quality","unixReviewTime":1511136000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1125"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NoBzuz6rL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cbytOnxUL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717pVJhXzlL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"13","verified":true,"reviewTime":"12 20, 2015","reviewerID":"A1HMSJIS4BGZS6","asin":"B0142PHFVU","style":{"Style:":" Old"},"reviewerName":"Ryan","reviewText":"Awesome Printer.

As many will say, 3D printing is not quite consumer ready yet. That said, it is great for people who are willing to take the time to tweak the settings to get things just right. You can come out with some pretty impressive results.\n\nStarting off, my printer didn't move right, just after getting it unpacked. It would go up, but it wouldn't move down very far. After talking to some people on the forums, I discovered that the X axis was not level due to not being level on the Z axis threaded rods. I used a digital caliper to level them, and it printed beautifully. My best advice, go to the forums, and ask for help. Even if they don't point out the exact problem, they will help figure things out.\n\nMatterControl, the default software, works well with the Robo. It is great for getting started, or if you don't want to tweak the printer very much. I don't despise it, unalike the people on the forums. That said, it does have its limitations. I don't blame the devs for these limitations, it is great free software, I have no room to complain. It works right out of the box.\n\nAfter reading some of the suggestions on the forums, I decided to try out Simplify 3D. It is not exactly plug and play with the Robo, unlike MC. That said, its ability to add and manipulate supports is second to none (as near as I can tell). It also gives you access to pretty much every setting you could want access to. You will have to tweak the Z axis offset, and possibly need to print with the SD card. The firmware on the printer occasionally stops communicating with the software, so that can cause problems. No one knows the exact reason why it happens, but we have found ways to work around it.\n\nAs a bit of a side note, only use the starter filament (the stuff that comes with your printer) for a little while. It is kinda cheap filament, that has some issues printing some items. I would recommend Hatchbox filaments, they seem to print quite nicely. I have yet to try anything other than PLA, so I won't advise anything there.\n\nThe Robo's firmware has temperature limits built in, so you may have to change them if you want to print at higher, or lower temperatures than the default limits. It is pretty easy to do, so don't worry about it. Just take a look at the forums, and ask for help if you can't find what you are looking for.\n\nOver all, the Robo is a good machine. Yes, people have had problems with it. You will have problems with virtually any of these complex machines. Remember, you are getting in at a time when hobby 3D printing is really just getting started. The Robo can provide very good prints, it can also have problems. Usually, it just takes carefully thinking through the problem, and troubleshooting it. Just like the early days of computers.\n\nPlease see some of my prints below as examples of what you can get.\n\nUpdate 12/12/2015:\nI am updating this to warn people that the 6 month warrantee is pretty much worthless. The company really doesn't cover much, so don't expect much actual assistance from the company.\n\nBasically, during normal operation, the print bed chipped. There is now a chunk of glass embedded in one of my prints, and a sizeable chunk missing from the build plate. Robo's warrantee doesn't cover this at all. Buying a replacement print bed is about $100, so it isn't cheap.\n\nI am moving from 4 stars to 3 simply because I don't like how deceptive the 6 month warrantee is. It sounds like the company will help you out during that time for standard wear and tear, that isn't the case.\n\nI have not gone lower than 3 because the printer has worked great until this point. So far, this is the greatest knock against it. I may suggest thinking of one of the other printers if you are on the edge. Printrbot \"might\" be a better choice. I have not tried them, so I don't know for sure. I just might suggest taking a longer look at other printers.\n\nUpdate 12/15/2015:\nI need to correct my earlier statement of the replacement print bed costing $100. The person I have been talking to through Robo has offered a replacement for $40 + shipping. This minimizes the sting a bit, but I won't put my rating higher. I still think that this should be covered under the warrantee. What is the point of it being 6 months, if it only really covers damage during shipping?\n\nI am less ticked, but I still recommend not expecting much from the 6 month warrantee. The printer works great when it works, which was most of the last few months. This is the first major issue to pop up. So, get the printer for its merits, and forget the warrantee.\n\nUpdate 4/2/2016\nI was able to set up the replacement print bed pretty easily. I decided to add a quick release, which made it pretty nice for completely removing the bed, without having to open the machine. I decided to up my rating for the machine simply because it is still working. As a few people have pointed out, the company's warrantee does cover several key components.\nI will admit that I was being a bit petty about the print bed, they did discount it. Generally the machine has been solid. Most of my problems have been caused by my inexperience. I have had no real problems with the machine since the printed bed. I bought some blue painter's tape, and have that applied over the bed. To the best of my knowledge, I have not had the bed chip since. I miss having glassy bottomed prints, but the matte look has its own appeal. :-)\n\nUpdate 7/21/2017\nI have had my Robo for around 2 years now. I recently switched out a bearing that went bad on the hobbled bolt. I also have upgraded it to a dual extruder printer, using the E3D Legends pack, particularly the Chimera setup. It is still a bit rough, but it works. :-) I had to switch from the custom RAMPS board that came with the printer, over to a standard RAMPS 1.4 board. I also had to print out a new X-carriage, along with a few other parts. It was challenging, but quite a learning experience.\nThough, like many on the forums, I would suggest buying a dual extruder printer pre-made if you can afford it. I only did it because I had the Robo, and dual extruders in my price range didn't have a build area nearly as large.","summary":"A Quality Printer (Look at Latest Update)","unixReviewTime":1445558400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1128"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qvZzMUdSL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IXB88Z+VL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MR-ejIZTL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zYL0MfrYL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"6","verified":false,"reviewTime":"10 22, 2015","reviewerID":"A2WCFDOCS73PNB","asin":"B0142PHFVU","style":{"Style:":" Old"},"reviewerName":"Gadgetman","reviewText":"I purchased the ROBO 3D R1 Plus printer from a local electronics store. Spent a couple of days including hours of interaction with the Robo 3D support before I was able to get the printer properly calibrated and running. Here is a summary of my experience and impression of this budget 3D printer.\n\nOverall appearance and packaging\n\n- the printer comes in a nice attractive box packed in heavy foam materials. The package includes a tool box with the necessary tools for doing our own maintenance and lubrication. It also comes with a glue stick for the heatbed and a sample 300g spool of PLA filament. This is nice as this would get us going without having to buy the parts and materials.\n- what surprised me a bit was that the movable parts (x-axis and z-axis motors assemblies) were not well secured by taping materials to avoid shipping damages. For my other color laser printers which have similar weight and sizes as the Robo 3D printer, they came with all the movable parts secured by tapes with clear instructions on removing and unpacking them. To no surprises, I found that the Z-end stop brackets were popped out. A couple of wiring connectors and a 5-pin motor control connector all came loose probably due to shipping and handling. I had to contact Robo3D support and receive a video instruction on putting the Z-end stop brackets back into its place.\n\nInstallation and software\n\n- The printers comes with a third-party software (MatterControl) on a SD card. Installation was pretty straight-forward. It also comes with a video instructions on assembling the printer.\n- The software comes with a load of features for controlling the printer quality, materials, and tuning / calibration. It also comes with a library of 26 ready to be printed 3D-models. The software shows the approximate print duration based on the materials, quality and complexity of the model. However, it does not show the remaining print time which could be very useful for monitoring the print status,\n- Once the print job begins, it would preheat the extruder and bed temperature before the actual printing starts. We can also pause or cancel the job anytime via the control panel.\n\nOperation\n- I started with printing the calibration circle model. To my dismay, the printer head's z-axis position was way high up from the heatbed and the printing turned out a messed up pile of dispensed filament. After searching on the web and support web site, I figured that the problem probably had to do with the Z-axis calibration. I also found that the wire connectors to the motors assemblies were not well secured and came loose quite easily\n- Fortunately Robo 3D had a nice support structure which allows us to book a 45 minutes appointment with a technician. The support personnel turned out to be quite knowledgeable and walked me through the calibration process over the phone. After the calibration, I was able to print the calibration circle perfectly. The calibration process was a bit tedious which should have been documented in the user manual or on the website.\nAfter the proper calibration, I did a couple of test prints which all turned out nice. Finally a happy camper.\n\nOverall\n- the Robo 3D is a nice budget 3D printer which can handle nice print volumes. There are quite a few rooms for improvements in their packaging, wiring assemblies, and calibration procedures. However, the support team is great and knowledgeable.  If you are mechanically inclined and don't mind to work through some tedious process to get the printer properly calibrated, this would be a good product to consider.","summary":"Nice budget 3D printer with rooms for improvement","unixReviewTime":1445472000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1129"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wQfpfRRaL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"3","verified":true,"reviewTime":"10 23, 2015","reviewerID":"A2W417TP4YKZLH","asin":"B0146ZCE1M","reviewerName":"hilo90mhz","reviewText":"Okay I have installed this and it does work great!

Also, I got the sonoluminescence project to work: glowing water :)\n\nI have a few really old oscilloscopes, but to this is my first signal generator that wasn't Synthesizer musical keyboard.\n\nOther reviewers mentioned the cool stuff you can do, like hooking this to a computer and drawing your own arbitrary waveforms.\n\nI'm using this for sonoluminesce: feed 25kHz to a piezoelectric transducer glued to a round distillation flask filled with water. A standing wave is formed that will trap an air bubble. The bubble will collapse and GLOW!\n\nAnyway, for my purposes at the moment this is awesome! I plugged in the two BNC cables. Each has two alligator clips at the other end. I clipped those onto the leads of a piezoelectric speaker disc (also tried it with RCA cable hooked to an amplifier and two stereo speakers) and I heard the sine wave!\n\nI turned the knob and the tone got higher. The cool part: I hit \"shift\" and selected the amplitude parameters. Turning the knob increased the voltage which made the wave I could hear get louder! Big deal: a volume knob? Well, in my electron microscope, sonoluminescence, piezo, oscilloscope experiments voltages can be important and the ability to set them is very, very nice.\n\nSo: in a pinch you could put the two alligator clips onto a headphone's jack and actually hear the tone. A very nice high output, that you can turn up louder. Of course, humans only hear about 20Hz-20kHz.\n\nMy goal is around 25.1kHz which will trap a bubble in a standing wave because it will be the resonant frequency of the glass distillation flask.\n\nThis is also easier to use for calibration than a synth keyboard.\n\nYou can apparently set a sweep range and speed, so I'll be able to set automatically sweep from say 25kHz to 26kHz so I don't have to turn the knob while I watch for cavatation in the water.\n\nThis device is super lightweight, but it works. It's light meaning that if you go to press a button it will slide away from you on the table. I just found a heavier piece of equipment to jam on top of it: problem solved.\n\nAll devices like this are best left running for a few minutes so they can stabilize.

R. Wu","reviewText":"Summary: Super fun, ideal for ages ~9 and up, though good for as young as ~6-7.\n\nI missed out on the Kickstarter for the 3Doodler 1.0, and in hindsight that was a good thing.  From what I can tell, the 3Doodler 2.0 is a much, much improved product.  That said, its still not perfect, and so takes some tuning / getting used to.  I managed to score my 2.0 on Kickstarter this time, and have been playing with it nonstop for over a week.  It does take some getting used to - the first ~2 strands I used didn't amount to anything, but I've just finished a cool mechanical sculpture.\n\n>>>Starting up the pen\nFirst of all, you have to realize that the feed mechanism has a long lead-in.  This means that from when the pen grabs the strand to when you start to get extruded melt takes time  like a good minute or so.  Take a look at where the strand is feeding into the pen, and if you can see it moving in, continue waiting.  Only if it appears stalled should you start to rotate the strand (gently) clockwise.\n\n>>>Shutting down the pen\nIf Im planning to start back up with the same strand, I will back the strand up 10 blinks, then unplug.  ODepending on what I plan to do, I will either remove the strand\n\n>>>Adjusting the pen temperature\nFor now I am finding it easier to work in 2D, then assemble the pieces into 3D.  This means its easier to work with a higher temp  about half a rotation on the adjustment screw.  If I want to extrude a thread which stands, I blow on it gently as it comes out to cool it faster.  As I get better, I will likely turn the temp back down.  One plus of the higher temp is better welding and faster feed, though there might be a higher risk of jamming.\n\n>>>Jamming\nMy theory on the distance between the feed gears and the melt chamber is that if the strand gets soft in the feed gears, it jams.  Note that the instructions indicate that you may need to let the 3Doodler rest from time to time.  I suspect that this is because the pen gets too warm - my observation is that this tends to happen more when you let the pen sit.  If you keep drawing and feeding more strand in, it doesn't have time to get hot inside the feed gears .  If the pen stops feeding while you're using it, give it a good few seconds, then back the strand out (press fast and slow feed simultaneously) then clip off the melted portion and start feeding again.\n\n>>>ABS vs PLA\nThey are not kidding about ventilation, though its much more with the ABS.  I ran about 3-4 strands through in the kitchen, which has decent airflow, but I got a bit of a headache from the smell.  Will set up a small fan nearby next time.  PLA on the other hand in our kitchen was no problem.  ABS does better standing structures though as it cools faster due to the higher melt temp.\n\n>>>Coil stock\nI bought a ~1 lb spool of 3 mm PLA - it works perfectly except that you do have to straighten it out a little before you use it.  As the strand does rotate as it feeds, you need to also cut it to a managable length.  I've been cutting mine to perhaps 15\" then manually unbending it a little.  This also softens up the PLA so its not as rigid.  I cut off a bunch at a time and re-vacuum seal the spool so it doesn't absorb moisture.\n\n>>>Tips:\n1) Use a fine tip sharpie to mark the strand when you're feeding - that way you can tell if it's moving or not\n2) Get yourself a set of small diagonal cutters - much easier to snip the strand\n3) Toss the larger silicone heat cover - it's useless and just gets in the way\n4) Double press the slow feed to start up a new strand and go read a book.  Seriously though, it takes a lot longer than you think it should.\n5) Get a clear flexible piece of plastic - I use a 5 mil empty laminating pouch.  I can then draw a pattern with pencil on paper, then use the 3Doodler to draw on the plastic - it sticks enough that you can work, then it pops off cleanly when finished.\n6) Get a small fan to keep the area ventilated, and also to cool your projects as you are working on them\n7) If you 3Doodler sketch is warped or bent, draw on it with some new material - this typically heats the part up enough that you can bend it a little, then hold it until it cools\n8) Don't be afraid to incorporate other materials in your sketches - PLA in particular sticks very well to paper, toothpicks, wood blocks, etc.\n\nIf you have questions, comments, or found this review helpful, please let me know!","summary":"Practice makes perfect  key tips for using, including coiled stock","unixReviewTime":1431475200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1146"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bXj3U-NdL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"3","verified":false,"reviewTime":"12 17, 2015","reviewerID":"A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","asin":"B015516HKU","style":{"Size:":" 6V 1A Adapter"},"reviewerName":"I Dont Do Reviews Anymore","reviewText":"AC Power Adapter for LotFancy Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor,UL Listed (6V 1A Adapter)\n\nIf you have one of the LotFancy upper arm blood pressure machines and want to save on batteries, getting this A/C adapter is a great idea.

A specialist accessory received for evaluation and review.  There are a whole range of uses for this versatile tool, but in a nutshell, it allows a thorough investigation of small, dark, hidden, out-of-range spaces.  The idea is the same as the medical version, a long flexible tube with a camera head (8.5 mm in this case) and some strong LED lights to illuminate the way at one end and a standard USB connector at the other.  The camera resolution offers a very useful quality range: up to 600 x 1200 pixels, and the images we get are really sharp, especially after a little experimentation.  The ability to regulate the light intensity is a definite asset.  This unit is waterproof and appears to be very tough and fit for the its intended applications;  some examples: investigating the state of a location out of reach of fingers and eyesight; locating an obstruction inside a tube or conduit (even full of water); verifying the condition of the back of appliances that cannot be moved; car repairs.  It's the sort of thing that, once you own it, you will find many uses for, that are not immediately apparent.\n\nWe initially tested it by photographing the inside of a Hummingbird electrified guitar.  The output jack had worked loose once again (it had already been sent back for professional remedial action once).  Due to the very limited space inside the guitar body, just enough for a slim hand, it was essential to know the exact situation.  We had already spent a lot of frustrating time trying to screw the piece back on.  Once the Endoscope head had been put into position, we were able to view the whole area and identify both the problem and the solution.  We fixed the guitar in under one minute.\n\nIn the box are the endoscope itself, some small tools that attach to the camera head (a hook, mirror and magnet), software installation CD, and a manual (also on the CD). The software loaded without problems on a laptop running Win 8.1.  Manoeuvring the photo head was easy enough (it would be even easier inside a tube), taking still photos and especially video were intuitive and successful.  The other option is to simply view the camera's progress on the screen, but recording the images may be useful.  I was quite blown away by the quality of the images, and the performance of this brilliant diagnostic tool.

I didn't remove any stars though because these weren't designed for an ottoman top to not smash a kids fingers so I don't tbink thats a product shortcoming.

Being that i am from the world of precision machinery, I got out my dial indicator and started taking some measurements. Everything was good, accurate to within tolerance for excellent 3d printing except for the bed. After leveling the bed with a dial indicator to less than 0.001\" between each of the 4 corner posts adjustment screw locations), the bed was \"bowed\" towards the center upwards about 0.012\" at its middle (not so good for large prints). This was completely unacceptable to say the least.\n\n I was not going to be so easily defeated, as i had heard the same complaint from a lot of other 3d printers with this same type of bed. I removed the bed, an aluminum plate with heater elements embedded into its under side held by 4 screws and a connector, and rolled 2 medium sized bath towels onto a hard floor, and placed the bed so that it was suspended in the center (high area). I then used my hands to press it downwards and \"flex it\" the direction it needed to go. I spent an hour or so progressively flexing the bed a bit (a little harder each time), then re-installing it, leveling it, and checking it. It took about 200 pounds of force (spread fairly evenly) to flex it back the other way, and about 8 or 9 progressive attempts while being careful not to over-do it.\n\n  Needless to say, I eventually got it to less than 0.002\" \"flex\" and a tolerance of about -0.001\" to +0.002\" across the entire bed. Personally, i don't think is was a manufacturing flaw form when it was built not so much as it appeared to be a settling of the bed because of the heating elements embedded into its bottom side. it simply took some patients and persuasion to get it right again. Other than that, there were no other problems with it.\n\nI have a backgorund in machining, automation, etc. but I have never used, owned, or even seen a 3d printer up close before getting this thing. I am a complete 100% n00b,.. and my first printing challenge was to print a complicated gear that went bad on my blend door for my A/C on my big-rig truck. I made a drawing in blender (linux) and after a few hours, i figured out that I needed the \"cura\" software for the printer. it was on the memory stick that came with it, but i downloaded the free (basic) linux version off the web instead. i followed the instruction manual (on memory stick too) on the settings to use and sent the gear as an \"STL\" file to cura. It refused to load it,..\n\nAfter more frustration, I learned that in blender you have to convert your mesh to triangles only (ctrl-T), and ensure there is no non-manifold, no loose geometry, mm scale, and I had to scale the finished part by a factor of 10x before exporting it. Once I did that, it worked and cura loaded it right up.\n\nThis gear had very fine teeth (0.3mm tips) and was 34mm in diameter. Difficult for any 3d printer to get right,.. but it printed like a champ and the gear looks fantastic!. I used PETG material on 240c and 20mm/s with 100% fill. i had to set fill speed manually (was a hidden setting) in cura to 20mm/s as well, it was going too fast in the middle first time I printed it. As you can see in the photos, the old gear, and the new one. i made the new one in 2 pieces with a \"snap-fit\" dimple so that it would not have to be glued. The new gear works absolutely fantastic and my A/C blend unit is like new again.","summary":"Seriously impressed... but had to fix the bed when I got it.","unixReviewTime":1477008000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1151"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711gLIKypHL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"17","verified":true,"reviewTime":"03 14, 2017","reviewerID":"A3ICLYIELELAA9","asin":"B015DQV4CS","reviewerName":"N.

First off this thing arrives in a very study cardboard crate. The most heavy duty cardboard box I have ever received through the mail. It's also 99.9% assembled. You will need to screw on a rather small spool holder in the back and load some filament. Tada you're done. The construction is amazing no seems, it's pretty much just one solid piece of steel. The rods are chromed steel and the z axis is running on beefy 10mm rods with nice bearings to match. I have a wooden frame flashforge creator that has been my work horse and this thing right out of the box beats it no problem. The bed was even already leveled. I printed a 150% scaled marvin at 1.2mm layer height and WOW looked perfect. If you email support they will send you a simplify3d profile as well. I printed a 40mm cube to see how accurate the dimensions it prints and right out of the box it prints well enough for 3dhubs new FDM guidelines, nice. The only con I have with it is that there is zero documentation on the board or the firmware. Which means if the board dies and the company is no longer around... better bust out that soldering iron and say goodbye to the lcd display because you are going to have to hack something else that will run on 24v together. Also even though I knew the dimensions of the build area when i bought it the machine doesn't use all of the print bed and that just kind of bothers me. Anyways, as someone who has a decent amount of experience with both using a plug and play printer and building my own I feel very confident recommending this guy to anyone who asks.

Not sure of the problem, have tried many other resources to fix the printing; new slicer, different temps, etc.  Nothing worked 100%.  By slowing the speed down to a crawl and using the slicer to fill in gaps, I was able to get what I would consider a 90% quality print.  The other prints in the picture are 3d Solutech.  All printed on a Maker Select v2.1 with best quality coming at 200/50.","summary":"Good, but not great","unixReviewTime":1528675200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1156"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715JFZwkbeL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bk6uFV1iL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"06 10, 2016","reviewerID":"A2REXU52Y5DZ2W","asin":"B015I1CZUI","reviewerName":"M Tech","reviewText":"Hatchbox's pla's are usually top notch when it comes to quality and color, this filament is no different!

Arnold","reviewText":"I looked at various 3D printers for weeks before settling on the Prusa i3 made by HICTOP. I chose this printer because of the frame being made from extruded aluminum, the heated aluminum bed, the integrated controller, and that it has mostly metal parts. I had my doubts about the quality of a printer built from a kit but those doubts were unfounded. This printer kit is made from quality parts and the assembled printer is equal to printers that cost $2000. I have seen some of the expensive printer's output and this printer is as good. I'm extremely pleased with the assembled printer and I am very glad I took a chance on this vendor. In addition to a great printer kit, the vendor has answered two of my questions promptly. One of the questions was a request for the controller firmware. They gave me the source code which even included the Arduino Environment. This company deserves much praise for putting together such a fantastic 3D printer kit. I do have to warn you that this kit takes quite a lot of time to assemble and parts of the process are difficult. It took me 12 hours of careful work to assemble the kit. If you don't think of yourself as mechanically or electrically inclined, this kit might be frustrating. After 12 hours assembling the kit and my wife getting a little irritated that I was in the garage all weekend, I turned it on for the first time. The motors whirred, the display lit up and it was ready to go. The first object I printed came out great which does not usually happen. HICTOP is thoughtful enough to supply a G-Code file for a Shamrock Cup all ready to go for this printer. You copy the file to a flash card and print from the card. I have run this printer for no less than 40 hours during the last week. It is tough, it is good looking, and it holds its calibration. Below are some details about the various parts of the printer kit.\n\nFrame - The frame is made from 20mm x 20mm extruded aluminum. This frame is stiff and straight. You can't even compare printers with plastic or wood frames to this industrial like chassis. The extrusions are held together with aluminum brackets that are beefy and hold each corner and the uprights true. It does take a bit of fiddling to get each corner flush so that the frame is square. I also had to work on getting the upright frame in the correct position and locked down by the side panels. The side panels are made of heavy gauge steel and hold the controller on one side and the power supply on the other side. I was expecting cheap screw hardware but was delighted to open a bag of hex cap screws which are all nickel or chrome plated. The hardware is so shiny that I can't tell if it is chrome or nickel. The kit includes tools to assemble the kit but I used my own. Almost all screws are cap heads which require various sizes of Metric Allen wrenches. The frame does not include end caps for the extrusion but I was able to print them from files found on Thingiverse. This kit is nearly all metal. The frame, the bed, the motor mounts, and the extruder are metal. The parts that are not metal are mostly thick black laser cut plastic. Really thick. The plastic parts are top quality including the few 3D printed parts.\n\nPlastic Hardware - Almost this whole printer kit is made from metal but there are some plastic parts including a few 3D printed parts. The 3D printed parts are the two X axis end pieces, the extruder feed, and the extruder fan shroud. Thats it. Those parts are nice solid 3D prints with no drooping or distortion. The laser cut parts include the bearing rod mounts (X, Y, and Z axis) and the Y axis pulley mounts. The laser cut parts are of beautiful with smooth edges and very precision. I am happy that there are more laser cut plastic parts than 3D printed parts. The quality is a bit better on laser cut parts.\n\nMetal Hardware - All of the motor mounts except the X axis are made from heavy gauge steel.  The LCD display and filament spool rack are metal as are the side panels and most of the extruder. The extruder is mostly metal but it does have a plastic feed mechanism which is one of the few areas I consider a little on the weak side.  All of the screws and various bits of hardware are all top quality. They in fact are nicer than I expected. Many of the metal pieces which attach to the extrusions use special slot fasteners. They are difficult to use at first but once you get the hang of installing them that are easy to use for attaching corner brackets, side panels, spool holder, and LCD display. All bearing rods were cut to the exact length and are chrome polished smooth and straight. The bearings (6) are all house in aluminum holders with threaded holes are beautifully made. I added a little 3in1 oil while assembling the bearing structures and everything moves silky smooth. Many printer kits use 3D printed bearing holders with tie wraps to mount them. The bearings on this printer are far better than many of the kits.\n\nElectronics  I was doubtful of an all in one controller where the motor drivers were on the board. One bad driver and the whole board is useless. So far so good. The controller is very nice quality. I especially like all of the JST connectors for stepper motors, end switches and temperature sensors. You cant plug them in backwards and each of the connectors is a different size based on function. The controller is actually a standard design called the MKS V1.3 and is made by multiple companies so replacements are available. The motor drivers run cool without a fan and I was able to easily get to communicate with my computer with the supplied drivers.\n\nSoftware, CD, and Example Files  Wow! They supplied a CD with everything you need. Cura is the slicer and control software.  They included the driver software. They included assembly documents, Cura setup document, bed leveling instructions, and examples. I found everything I needed. I requested and received the controller firmware. These guys did a great job. There are also videos on YouTube showing much of the same things as the documentation.  I really like Cura. Its fun and easy to use.\n\nDocumentation and Assembly Instructions  The main assembly document is 95 pages long and is very detailed. It depends on CAD drawings to show each step. There is little text but I was able to figure it all out without too much trouble. I did not print the document. I placed it on a laptop and flipped through it from there while completing each step. I actually had a lot fun putting this printer together and would not hesitate to help a friend build one.\n\nTools and Extras  HICTOP supplies a bag of tools needed to assemble the printer and they include all kinds of supplies including masking tape for the heated bed, wire ties, extra screws, and a small amount of filament. You can tell they really want you to be successful. Everything needed to build the printer is in the kit.\n\nPackaging - The printer arrived in a sturdy box with all parts wrapped in plastic and placed in foam pockets. There are two layers with the parts and minimal instructions on the top with a CD with the full instructions and software. I was very glad to see the CD. I was quoted a 4-6 week delivery time but much to my delight, the printer arrived in 4 days!!! Dont count on this happening but its nice to know that they aren't putting kits together after they get an order. I was so happy to open the kit and to see the great quality parts.\n\nNo product is perfect including this printer. I really like this printer and would do it all again. I did run into a few minor problems which I will mention so you can avoid them if you decide to buy this printer. The bearing that provides the idler end to the Y axis belt was too tight between its mounting ears. I had to leave the screw loose so as to not bind its action. I consider this a minor issue.  All of the sheet metal that connects to the extrusions uses M5x8 metric screws which are just a bit too long. They bottom out in the extrusion. The solution is to add a washer. I had some washers so this was only a minor hindrance. The manual fails to remind you to switch the power supply to 110V for USA operation. I knew about this issue from reading other reviews so I wasn't stumbled by it. This is very important to not if you live in the USA. The wiring section of the manual is a little terse but they do supply a great diagram that is enough to get you through it. My extruder nozzle was a 0.8mm not a 0.4mm. This caused me some problems because I entered 0.4mm per the instructions for Cura. Once I installed another nozzle which was 0.4mm, everything was OK.  Thats it. If you read the reviews, you will know about the power supply and now about the correct extruder nozzle issue from me.  Last, the USB cable is 6 long and is useless so you will need your own USB cable\n\nIm printing all kinds of things as is typical of new 3D printer owners. I am amazed at how solid this printer is and that it does a great job on prints that run for hours. I successfully printed the MakerBot articulated robot which is used for testing printers. I couldn't be happier with this printer.\n\nUpdate: Jan 12, 2016\nI have downgraded this product by one star because there are design flaws which must be addressed for this printer to be reliable and accurate. I have addressed the flaws to my satisfaction but others may be expecting a more turnkey experience. This comment explains how some people are happy with this kit and others bash it. I can't emphasize enough that this kit requires a significant investment in your time and that it requires a lot of tweaking to make it a reliable and accurate printer. If you are willing to invest that time, you can make a $400 kit into a 3D printer that equals assembled ones that cost $1500-2000.

[...]\nUpdate: June 24, 2016\nI pleased to tell you that HicTop has added the upgraded Z axis lead screws to their aluminum fram 3D printer kits. This upgrade will provide a needed boost in print quality. If they are reading this review, the next thing they should upgrade is the 3D printed filament feed with an aluminum one. Users can do this upgrade but it would be better if HicTop provided it in the kit. My HicTop Prusa i3 is still going strong with many hundreds if not a thousand hours of operation. I'm still running this printer 4-5 hours per day on average. It has become a stable and reliable tool for my business and hobbies. If you decide to buy this printer, please consider joining the Yahoo Group for HicTop owners. We have lots of good suggestions and will help you to get your printer running.\n[...]\nUpdate: March  2017  My printer is still going strong. I used it to print the 45 parts needed to build a CoreXY printer. My HicTop and the CoreXY support my business needs of printing electronic enclosures. I recommend HicTop and commend them for the continuous upgrades they have made to their 3D printing products.","summary":"Excellent 3D Printer that Prints as Well as a $1500-2000 printer","unixReviewTime":1446422400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1162"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vaTWzvl6L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nmPV-4JRL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":3,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"04 24, 2017","reviewerID":"A2M4EWM3KG6177","asin":"B015IHMOSK","reviewerName":"Derek","reviewText":"BE WEARY.

However, after some use, the extruder heater element came loose during printing and was glowing red hot!. So, be careful and make sure the heater doesn't come loose. This could be a significant fire hazard. And, as far as I can tell, there is no safety on this product to turn it off if something wrong happens. Be warned.\n\nThis is a good 3d printer for the price. If you need any minor missing parts, order them. It will be faster. I had some missing xbeam nuts and the belt material was too short for both x and y axis. As soon as I discovered issues I ordered parts. As I expected, I emailed HICTOP with the address in the documentation. They wanted photos etc. I still do not have replacement parts from them. So, expect poor customer service. I had an issue where the x and y pullies wouldn't tighten. The allen wrench didn't fit right. The new belt kit came with pullies and they worked great. I did have to drill out the holes to the parts that captivate the Z axis nuts for the screw drive. I still have a squeek, but it works. So what. Over all, this is a good value for the money. Take your time putting the kit together. Pay attention to the details. Especially the wiring. I used many extra zip ties. The instructions don't tell you how to harness the wires. It will become obvious once the wires are properly connected. I recomend labeling the wires at the connectors so you know what they are once harnessed. I ended up zip tieing the exdruder z-axia cable to the middle of the top bar. Previously, it would snag. The y axis plate would snag too. I used several rubber bands to pull it up so it wouldn't jam.

From the description I assumed I would have to use an external push button to set the frequency range but when I got the parts I found that they do have push button capability.  However, you have to install a 10k pull up on the board for it to function.  Unfortunately the board is laid out for surface mount parts but since I have a stock of surface mount resistors and experience with precision soldering it wasn't a problem.  So be advised.  I suppose you could put an external 10k pull up but that is an inelegant solution, imo.  Anyway, I connected it to my Uno, slapped together some code and the unit worked perfectly.\n\nThere have been some of complaints about the boards that I'd like to address.  First off, all of the boards I received all are threaded.  The diameter is .267 inches.  They may be metric so the closest metric equivalent is 7 mm.  I would have taken off a half of a star for not providing mounting hardware but considering the price they are worth a trip to the store for a nut and washer.  As for accuracy, most encoders or even switches require some sort of  debouncing in a high speed circuit.  The simplest way is to debounce them is in software with a short timing delay.  I had no problem with accuracy for the ones I bought.  Finally, for those out there without experience using rotary encoders go visit howtomechatronics.com and click on the rotary encoder tutorial.  Since I don't believe in reinventing the wheel I copied his code and built upon it.\n\nUpdate 27 Nov. 16:\nI've added a schematic for a hardware implementation debounce interface.

The mirror is too small, most of what fills the view is the outline of the mirror itself and not what you're trying to inspect. The hook I received won't even attach to the Endo, it's slightly too small to fit around.\n*The included software can't be run from the CD, if you do it won't let you exit the program since it can't save a file.

My success rate dropped from a wonderful 99% to 10%. The first issue came when prints would have a random or specific layer just get completely messed up, no bonding, and the rest of the print infill would be messed up entirely. Using different filaments, different Gcode files, different .stl files, the problem is really bad. So I updated my program and firmware, had an immediate jam with FlashForge red filament. Had to disassemble the entire print head to extract the piece. The same day had another jam with Hatchbox filament. Then I couldn't manage to get the build plate level or the extruder in the same place reliably, it would make an unholy grinding sound and sometimes, randomly, the build plate would be entire inches away from the head when it starts extruding.\n\nI got in touch with FlashForge support, who were mildly helpful but never got any of the severe issues resolved. Every time I tried one of their fixes, it either didn't help or got worse. It drives me mad because it WAS working amazingly well, and now is almost unusable. Entirely disappointing, I'll be returning this shortly.\n\nNotes: I have gotten successful prints, I do know how to level the print bed, I'm good with troubleshooting devices. It's my job to fix smartphones. The photos include all my recent failures, and this doesn't include the innumerable times the print just extruded into thin air, didn't stick to the plate, or was jammed so hard into the plate that it didn't print 3 layers.\n\n-end edit-\n\n2 weeks in, so far, so good. Been really enjoying using it so far, I've been printing near nonstop with it. I'd say without a shadow of doubt that this is the most newbie-friendly printer on the market. I did a huge amount of research on which printer to get, since this is my first endeavor into 3D printing, and this seemed like the best blend of simplicity and affordability. There are cheaper printers, yes, but they're usually DIY which seem very finicky and time consuming. This printer is very simple to set up, I had my first print completely done in under 45 minutes from receiving the UPS box.\n\nSetup\nWhen I received the printer, it came well packaged with a lot of styrofoam and clips. Be sure to get all the packaging off. After plugging it in and setting up the packaged spool of filament (mine was red), I leveled the build plate (which in itself is a easy and guided process) and printed the included 20mm cube. It printed the cube in 11 minutes, and it was extraordinarily difficult to get off the build plate. I had to mangle the poor cube to get it off the plate. Maybe I goofed up or something, but since then I've been using 3M blue printers tape. I use a pocket knife to pry prints off the build, which works well. Side note, turning down the temperature to 210c (from my experience) helps keep the prints from fusing to the plastic.\n\nFilaments\nI tried to get a pretty wide range of colors when I initially bought the printer. I was guessing that I'd get red with the printer, as other people have, so I ordered: (not sponsored just recommendations)\n-FlashForge Green, 0.67kg\n-HatchBox Yellow, 1kg\n-HatchBox Blue, 1kg\n-ProMolt Professional Black, 1kg\n-Solutech Real Wite, 1kg\nI've had great success with all of those filaments. You can use the 3rd party spools no problems, but I'd recommend a spool holder. I got a cheap one from Hatchbox, has worked great for everything I'd needed. The only filaments I've had any issues with (and they're minor) have been the FlashForge filaments, they work good on a technical level but they're fairly transparent. If that's what you want, great, but just be aware that it doesn't look as nice for figures or statues (in my opinion).\nLoading and unloading filaments has been a bit unusual, I haven't figured out how to pull the filament out of the extruder head so I just cut the filament off right at the input, then select Settings > Filament > Load, wait for it to heat up, then extrude that inch or two of plastic out. It works pretty well and takes under a minute, you just feed the new filament in behind it. Haven't had any issues with the filament clogging or anything, though at high temps like 220c (where it preheats to by default) it does slowly drip out in little strings. Be sure to clear those before you print.\n\nPrint Bed\nPrint bed seems a bit small in terms of other 3D printers, but I've made due. Usually you can scale down or slice models to fit on the bed. Be aware that 5.5\" cubed isn't massive, but can get the job done for most things. I haven't tried printing directly onto the print bed since my very first 20mm cube, and I had a heck of a time getting that cube off. I've been using 3M blue painters tape since then, and have had a lot more success with it. Be sure to turn the temperature down, 220c is a bit too hot and will want to fuse with the painters tape. If I get lucky I can pop the print off the tape and reuse the tape, though usually I replace the tape every print or two.\n\nSoftware\nThe bundled software is great. It's not a 3D modeling program, but it's great to taking models and quickly converting them into printable models. It's a requirement, as far as I know, before you can print something. I use a MacBook Pro, and the software works pretty great. I'd recommend changing some of the default print settings, like turning infill down to 10% or 5%, and turning the temperature down. I'm running at 210c, though I want to experiment with 200c. The tree-like auto supports are great, they're usually pretty easy to remove and help keep complex builds nice and secure. However, I really don't like rafts. They rarely come off in one piece and are frustratingly strong to remove. Especially on models that have a solid bottom, it just fuses with the bottom. I've had no issues printing the supports directly onto the print bed, so that's what I'd recommend.\nThe on-printer software, accessed via touchscreen, is great too. Very user friendly and easy to operate, it's nice to be able to access a bunch of settings right on the printer. Plus preheating and selecting a print is easy too. It copies the print to the printer's internal hard drive, so once the print starts you can unplug your computer or unplug the flash drive with no problem.\n\nPLA Plastic\nThis printer only prints in PLA. Some would consider this a negative, I don't have a problem with it though. Personally speaking, as a newbie to printing, PLA is the only plastic I'm interested in. It's very easy to work with, you don't have to deal with a heated print bed or finicky fan speeds or anything like that. PLA prints don't tend to warp if the temperature isn't perfect. Not to mention that PLA is cornstarch based, so it is eco friendly and smells nice while printing. The smell is very subtle, though I keep my room well ventilated. PLA isn't as tough as ABS, and may not perform as well in high-stress or high-heat environments, but I haven't found anything to print that needs to be stress-tested. I printed a very thin support for an herbs plant, and the supports were amazingly flexible. For beginners, I'd highly recommend PLA over ABS.\n\nPrints\nSince this is a PLA printer, it can print at 4 resolutions: low (draft, 0.3mm), standard (0.18mm), high (0.14mm), and hyper (0.08mm). I do the vast majority of my prints in standard, and they come out looking very nice. You can clearly see the print layer, but they're subtle and very uniform. I've also printed at high definition, and at that point the layer lines start to fade. I haven't yet printed in hyper, but the time it takes to print in hyper is unreal, so only save that for when you absolutely need to.\nThe prints usually come out very nice and clean. Sometimes there will be little strings or webs between pieces, but they can quickly be cleaned up with a knife or just your hands. Usually print problems are things I could have fixed, like an overhang that should have had a support but I forgot to add it. The printer has not EVER completely failed a print on it's own. All of the failed prints were either because 1) I forgot to add supports for an overhang greater than 45, 2) there was a raft that fused moving pieces together, or 3) the power went out and canceled the print (consider a UPS battery backup maybe). I haven't had the printer go haywire and screw up a print on it's own yet. It helps that the software it uses is pretty solid and good at detecting problems.\n\nIssues\nThe issues for this have been minor. Once I added the blue painters tape to the print bed, no amount of releveling would get the print head to get the right height. It would drag the print head through the tape, and wouldn't print the first layer of plastic at all. To get it working better, I releveled the bed with an additional piece of paper or two, to get the extra height I need. I've contacted FlashForge about this issue, and I haven't heard back yet.\nBesides that, the only other issue is the on-printer screen is sometimes a bit janky. While scrolling through my flash drive full of files, it might act like I tapped twice and select something two folders deep. Some people might consider the PLA only or the print bed size problems, but I've managed no problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the FlashForge Finder is just about the best printer I could recommend for a beginner or someone looking to get into 3D printing for the best time. It's no the most flexible, it's not very upgradable like a DIY printer, but it's also very stable and very easy to use. PLA plastic is beginner friendly, and I've had wonderful success with it.\n\nPROS:\nVery affordable\nSimple to setup and use\nMinimal tinkering required\nAccepts 3rd party filaments\nRemovable build plate (easy to put tape down on it)\nNo print failures due to the printer itself so far\nNice bundled software\nOn-board 4gb hard drive, to prevent interruption\nQuite and low-smell\n\nNEUTRALS:\nPLA only, depends on your goals\nBuild plate size, once again depends on your goals\nNo major upgrades or tinkering potential\n\nCONS:\nBuild plate size can be a bit restricting, depending on your goals\nOn-board slot for PLA spool is proprietary only and only 0.67kg\n\n(side note about photos: I have printed more than just Pokemon, it's just what I had on hand)","summary":"Great at first.

I have been gazing at them on Amazon.com for a long time, mulling over the alternatives and weighing the benefits of spending more or less.  I guess my trepidation was the cost and if I spent a lot of money and it eventually just sat in a corner, well I'd feel guilty for spending.  When I saw this new printer from FlashForge, and considering all of the favorable reviews regarding the seller's customer service on its other products, well it made me jump in.  (I used Amex points to buy it so wow that made it affordable! Thanks Amazon and Amex).\n\nI can tell you when I received the email from FlashForge's Tang, I got excited.  I can tell you that I have bought a lot of things from Amazon and I had not received such an email.  It was kind of fun to be able to read the manual while I was waiting that last day for delivery.  Plus, it made me an educated customer, so I believe I was more restrained during the carton opening.  I knew exactly what to expect and what to do.\n\nAfter completing the setup, my kids and I wanted to get printing, so we printed out the cube demo.  My Finder came with a translucent white spool of PLA, and that was great because it allowed us to watch how the print included the hexagonal fill and when completed, you can hold it to the light and see the internal detail.  Knowing about that fill option is an advantage to someone not experienced at 3D printing, like me (see later here).\n\nToo excited to end the evening, my daughter (7years old) asked to print out something for her.  We went to Thingiverse and printed a little kitty keychain (props to somethingc on Thingiverse).  It took 45 minutes and my daughter watched the entire time.\n\nThen, my son found Horrible zombie! by BOBUSMALUS on Thingiverse and we proceeded to print that.  Well, that was going to take a while so we started it up and we put the kids to bed.  Waking up the next day was like Christmas morning for my kids, they ran to the printer and voil it looked great.  Getting the tree supports off the print revealed its fragility, but my son thinks it looks cool without an arm, but we just put it in his other hand and it looks more gruesome.  I printed it with grey PLA which I bought at the same time as the printer.\n\nSo far it is a blast.  I can say that it is easy to set up (almost no set-up and no assembly) and super easy to extract the print files from an STL file to get it to print.  You will want to check out all of the print options (remember the honeycomb fill) so that you are educated on how it will print and consume the PLA.  I started a print of my own later and mistakenly filled what I wanted to be hollow.  But once I noticed, cancelling the print and starting over is a breeze.\n\nI'm pretty good with computers and with 3D design (started out in engineering) but I can say it all still seems quite easy to use.  I expect a lot from Software, and I think that the FlashPrint software (I'm a mac user and it installed easily) is pretty good.  If you have used 123D Design, well you will feel at home in FlashPrint.\n\nOverall very great experience so far:\n1: Easy to set up\n2) Easy to use\n3) It WORKED\n4) fun as heck for the kids to see/learn/use\n5) Initial quality VERY GOOD (will update in a few weeks, if I remember)","summary":"Exceeded My Expectations","unixReviewTime":1464998400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1188"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hhNApjmaL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EWHwHdzkL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cemQ5wK8L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71whvhkRbRL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qr0AlunQL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71auK-ni0XL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81G7WfVEl0L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81y811ytGYL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"279","verified":true,"reviewTime":"05 21, 2016","reviewerID":"AMJLW6RCJ0LNS","asin":"B016R9E7J2","reviewerName":"Guy M. Hoovler","reviewText":"Update January 2017 - Printed with Ninjaflex filament, no issues.  The latest FlashPrint software incudes presets for a few different types of filament now, including flexible PLA.  This printer just keeps amazing me!\n\nUpdate October 3 - succeeding with large, complicated prints, attached a picture of the skull model I found on Thingiverse. They key is getting the print bed truly level over a large area, which I explained in my June 9th update below. Still love this printer!\n\nUpdate August 17, 2016 - Email support from FlashForge is outstanding.  They always respond in 12 hours or less, and whether it's tech support questions or replacement parts needed, they have the right answers.  I'm still very happy with the print quality and overall capability - adding a picture of the most recent and very complex print of a skull I downloaded from Thingiverse.  I'm also getting better at designing my own parts and decorations using 123D Design, picking up skill from various videos and articles online.  What a great hobby, and this printer never lets me down.\n\nUpdate July 31 2016 - I've lost count of how many prints I've done, and this thing is still going strong.  Since my last update, I've had a few interactions with tech support - once to order additional blue tape covers and an additional print bed (cheaper than I expected and shipped fast from China), and more recently I had a failure with the board that's installed on the print head and controls the stepper and heater block.  I sent a picture and a description of the failure, they responded right away and shipped me TWO replacement boards under warranty.  I swapped it out and this thing is printing great again, I printed a Barbie doll chair and table for my daughter.  Since my last review, I also printed with Hatchbox PLA filament and that worked really well as well.  Overall still very happy with this printer!\n\nUPDATE June 9 2016 - after about 30 prints, I'm even more thrilled!  You MUST get the printing platform COMPLETELY level to print larger models, and the built-in automatic leveling routine doesn't quite get it there.  What I do is this - set the extruder gap with a piece of paper, then use the leveling utility.  Then set the extruder gap again, but use the FlashForge print utility from your PC to manually move the printhead around to various points on the print surface, rechecking the gap with a piece of printer paper and adjusting the height knobs to get it fully level.  Since doing this, I have had zero issues with one edge of the raft lifting.  Yes there is still a small learning curve, but this thing prints AWESOME when it is dialed in. I added pics of my most recent printout of the self-watering plant pot from thingiverse.com to prove it!\n\nUPDATE June 6 2016 - after about 20 prints, I stand by my review.  Maybe 4.5 stars - it's not quite plug and play over time, be prepared to fiddle with how you print to get more complex designs to print.  I have installed a BuildTak stick-on printing surface, and I've had to figure out how to take apart the extruder print head to clear a jam, and I've had to totally disassemble the extruder to clean the print nozzle.  However - for the price, it still beats everything else out there.  You just can't quite assume yet that you don't need to know anything about 3D printing to use this.  But it's sooooo easy, you'll be hooked!!!!!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nThis is my first 3D printer.  I have looked at them for a while, and I have a friend who did a ton of research and bought this intense hobbyist printer, took him all weekend to set it up, and it seems that every other print doesn't come out right for some reason - he is slowly becoming an expert at the entire science of 3D printing.\n\nI have plenty of hobbies, and while I wanted a 3D printer to support those hobbies, I didn't want to have to learn a lot to use it.  I also didn't want to spend a fortune.  When I saw the price drop on this printer, read the other reviews, and watched a few youtube videos, I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nEverything worked exactly as expected!  Right out of the box, following simple setup and calibration steps, my first four prints have been a total success.  I'm still learning about rafts and supports and fill, but it is just as easy as downloading a model from thingiverse, loading it into the FlashPrint software, and sending it to the printer.\n\nAnd the print quality on the default settings was MUCH better than I'd expected, after seeing what my friend printed on his super hobby machine.  Keep in mind that I mostly want to print toys and utilitarian things - shelves, hooks, etc. - and I'm not sure what others expectations are, but mine were blown away.  I attached a pic of a toy elephant model I printed - legs and head move.  My daughter loved it!","summary":"Updated after more than 50 prints - Easy and Powerful - great tech support!","unixReviewTime":1463788800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1189"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TyY9z-O9L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"114","verified":true,"reviewTime":"05 12, 2016","reviewerID":"A9SWXSVCHJS6L","asin":"B016R9E7J2","reviewerName":"G.C.","reviewText":"This printer is amazing.

Mine arrived with two incorrect parts and had I noticed the problem at the early stages, I would have packed it up and returned it.  But I was well into assembly by the time I recognized the problems.  The most serious problem involved the factory installation of two left wheel locks in stead of one left and one right wheel lock.  As one can see in the pictures below, both wheel locks have the step plate going in the same direction.  I did not notice this problem until I completed installation of the left wheel and upon adding the right wheel noticed it would not go all the way in because the wheel lock had the step going towards instead of away from the wheel (see the second picture below).  I solved the problem by cutting off the section that extends towards the wheel and it still works just fine.  But the consumer should not be required to do remanufacturing to get things to work.  The second problem was that only one of the wheel nuts that was included was a lock nut.  The others were all regular nuts and a lock nut is required to hold the wheel on as a regular nut, if tightened down, would prevent the wheel from turning.  A lock nut can be tightened just enough to keep the wheel on while allowing for free rotation.  I solved the problem by using a thread sealer that served to hold the nut in place.\n\nAfter suffering through assembly, I then used the Shop Vac to clean the basement floor and the work room.  It worked beautifully, and was very impressive in terms of suction and the extensions and attachments were of high quality.  Indeed, the 8 foot hose is the best vacuum hose I have every seen.  Thus, I gave the unit 5 stars for performance and 3 stars for pain and suffering during assembly.\n\nMy strong recommendation is that you carefully check all the parts including the installed parts and if anything is missing, return it to Amazon for replacement.  It is very hard to tell through the plastic whether you have a lock nut or a regular nut, however.  But the lock nuts are a lot thicker and have small round marks on two faces which are indentations to make the nut hard to turn on the screw.  The company should be dinged for using such a cheap lock nut, and dinged even more for not including the right number. Fortunately, if you or going to buy a shop vac from a company with no quality control, Amazon is a great place to buy such a thing because replacement is so easy.\n\nIt is unfortunate that something that works so well once assembled is shipped without paying attention to the details, but I still recommend this item because it works so well.  It is very solidly built, and moving it up and down the stairs is quite easy because of the design, excellent handle and large rear wheels.  Storing all the attachments inside is also very convenient.\n\nIn summary, just make sure you have all the parts before starting to assemble.  And for the cretin who will invariably add a comment that I am the fool for not checking the parts before assembling, I was indeed partially to blame.  Let this review prepare you for the fact that this company seems to lack quality control during assembly and parts preparation.  But once you get the thing put together, this is indeed a 5 star shop vac.","summary":"Works Great but Terrible Quality Control can make Assembly Challenging","unixReviewTime":1453593600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1201"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FlHlg-ZEL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bP+K8HhZL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"2","verified":false,"reviewTime":"02 3, 2016","reviewerID":"A3GAJB5Y9XCLHU","asin":"B017EOLHME","reviewerName":"J.

It has done very well with any job I've tasked it with. The suction is incredibly strong and has worked for all my workshop messes. The front of the orange debris drawer does flex inward when pulling a hard vacuum, so it would be nice to see slightly thicker plastic there. This unit is VERY quiet. It's about the noise level of a normal stand-up vac which is very unusual. Nice for people like me that are apartment dwellers.\n\nThe reason this isn't five stars is attention to detail. My unit came with the brake levers installed on the wrong sides, making wheel installation impossible. After swapping them, it was no sweat. See the attached photo of the manual diagram and what I received. I also didn't get the dust bags in my box. The shipping carton was not very sturdy, but for such a beefy product it worked without problems.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a powerful shopvac, this is a good option, but for the price I do expect the manufacturing problems to be fixed ASAP.","summary":"Great vacuum, manufacturing/shipping needs some work!","unixReviewTime":1454457600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1202"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oGihVzB7L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"01 31, 2016","reviewerID":"A3EXW4HNYX7HF5","asin":"B017EOLHME","reviewerName":"Atomic Tofu","reviewText":"I must say, I didn't experience any quality control issues some have had with the RIDGID VAC1100 Smart Cart Wet Dry Shop Vacuum with LED Car Nozzle and Dust Bags.  I initially thought I did as you can see in the pics but not enough to warrant any tangible points with this shop vac.\n\nI received all assembly parts.  The two brakes were installed opposite to each other and when I was putting the wheels on, I just didn't think the \"wings\" rubbing up against the wheels was how it should be.  Now I don't know if other people received wrong parts or didn't try to swap pieces but that is what I did.  I unscrewed the securing panels on each side and merely swapped them.  Voila, wheel brakes fixed.\n\nThe RIDGID VAC1100 Smart Cart Wet Dry Shop Vacuum with LED Car Nozzle is awesome.  As the complete name implies, you get an led lit car nozzle.  This is so very much needed when we are cleaning our vehicles and especially near the seat crevices.  The Vac1100 is so well designed.  All of the parts and accessories for the shop vac will remain with the shop vac.  There are storage compartments for the attachments and the extension poles are stored in the back corners.  The handle can even be pushed down for more storage options.\n\nOn top of all the accessories you get, the well designed nature of the Vac1100 and the quality construction you get the blowing function that doesn't seem all that well advertised.  I haven't had the opportunity to test the blowing function yet other than blowing dust out of the garage so perhaps the Vac1100 isn't strong enough to blow much more than that but such a feature is a bonus.  For me it is also surprisingly light as I pulled it out of the shipping box.  The only drawback I could potentially see is how the item is shipped.  It's shipped in the box it came in, a plain brown shipping box.  There is not much cushioning provided but perhaps luckily it is light enough that delivery people can handle without much problems.","summary":"What an awesome shopvac.","unixReviewTime":1454198400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1203"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u1GibIGIL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RB--loiiL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EAEeRmIBL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"17","verified":false,"reviewTime":"12 2, 2015","reviewerID":"A1DG75OT3Y49EM","asin":"B017EOLGJI","reviewerName":"Raistlin","reviewText":"I've been using a large Ridgid wet dry vac for years and am very happy with it.

My vacuum came with a claw piece and a round small brush for attachments. It did not come with the flat square attachment in the pictures. Also, the claw doesn't stay in well. It slides in and out of the hose easily. (The ridges aren't wide enough. I'll post a picture.) If you don't hold on to it you'll lose it when you try to reach between seats or other tight spaces.

However, straight off the reel this product works well,, Good table and layer to layer adhesion, good color and color consistency, great prints all the way around with almost no strings and or layer lines. This really does work well. Everything about the plastic is excelent. My only gripe and reason for the 4 star is there are several areas on the role where the plastic is lopped under itself.

Edelman","reviewText":"After a lifetime working in science and high tech. you'd think I'd get jaded about new technology- but I never do. I'm still constantly astounded at the progress in making electronic devices smarter, faster, cheaper, and more powerful. Case in point: This new hand held thermal viewer from Reveal.\n\nThe first Thermal imager I ever saw was on an M1 Abrams tank, and I think it cost around $250,000. Some years later I saw industrial thermal viewers that could be had for only $10,000 or so. Bu the last year has seen an explosion in inexpensive devices. Now you can get a real, working thermal imager for the price of a cell phone.\n\nThere's no manual included with the reveal for the simple reason that you don't need one. Push the big button in the middle and it turns on. Everything else is done via simple menus. The first time you turn it on, it'll step you through setting the time and date, date display format, and automatic time out setting, and after that, it just turns on and goes immediately into view mode. Controls in view mode are simple- just two buttons. One will step you through different filters, from which you can select the one that gives you the most detail in what you're viewing, and the other stores the image you're viewing on the included micro-SD card.\n\nAfter scanning the room, my computer, body parts, handprints left on walls, and other things around me I thought I should try something practical, like looking for home heat loss, so I put on a warm coat and headed outdoors. I didn't expect any surprises, as I had made a point of improving and updating all my insulation some years ago during a home remodeling project.  Even so,  I was immediately rewarded with some very surprising and useful information. Take a look at the photos, and you'll see a bright band of yellow right at the bottom of my house, where the basement extends above ground level. That's called the bond, and while it's often a major source of heat leakage, I'd made a point of insulating this area during the remodel after consulting with a contractor friend who specializes in energy efficiency. Yet even with the added insulation I've obviously got major heat loss here- something I can now address and then check with this imager.\n\nSeek, the maker of this imager, has a number of suggestions for using the Reveal, like tracking downed game, looking for your pet, checking your yard for intruders (human and otherwise), checking tires for wear, looking for electrical problems, tracing clogged pipes and a whole lot more. I suspect I'll be pretty busy this week exploring everything it can do.","summary":"Amazing (and useful) technology for not a lot of  money.","unixReviewTime":1447286400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1220"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Uy4+bLeJL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"03 8, 2016","reviewerID":"A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ","asin":"B017OFTGAS","style":{"Color:":" Black"},"reviewerName":"Juniorverse","reviewText":"This filament works great with my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dremel-Idea-Builder-3D-Printer/dp/B00NA00MWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dremel Idea Builder 3D Printer</a>, even though they recommend their own (more expensive) brand only.

I do have a carpet cleaner, but in close quarters at this time of year, I don't want to use it.  Its not recommended that one use a carpet cleaner on wool rugs, but I do as part of my spring cleaning regimen.\n\nMy predominantly ivory-colored wool oriental was a poor choice given the type of dogs I have.  One of them can swoop through a door and track mud all over the floors and that oriental in no time flat.  I have used an all-natural carpet cleaner before, primarily as a spot cleaner.  I decided that Id give Puracy a try, but not in the carpet cleaner, but by hand.  I hauled out a bucket and gave it a try.\n\nI poured about three quarts of warm water in a bucket along with a single ounce of the Puracy (1 oz. Cleaner:  100 oz. Water).  Mind you, an ounce isn't much cleaner and this container is going to last a very, very long time.  It hardly looked as if I used much, if any of it.  Once I had my formula ready, I began to work on the rug.  I did used a sponge, working the formula into the top layer of the rug.\n\nIn spite of having vacuumed through, I was still pulling up quite a bit of dirt from the carpet.  By the time I got through, I had a pretty grungy looking pail of dirty water, as expected.  I didn't have to scrub like crazy, but rather a gentle, but firm circular motion seemed to do the trick.\n\nWhat I liked was that I didn't have to saturate the rug to get results.  I was easily able to clean the rug without having to go through a lot of cleaning formula with more than satisfactory results.  I also like the fact that the Puracy is a plant-based formula.  Granted I do use plenty of chem-laden products, but if I can I do like to use chem-free, especially if the results are satisfactory.  Im very pleased with the results and would definitely spend the asking price (around $20) to keep this product on hand.\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nPurified Water, Decyl Glucoside (Plant-Based Cleanser), Octyl Dimethyl Amine Oxide (Plant-Based Cleanser), Lauramine Oxide (Plant-Based Cleanser), Tetrasodium Iminodisuccinate (Biodegradable Water Softener), Zinc Ricinoleate (Natural Mineral-Based Odor Removal Agent), Sodium Citrate (Plant-Based Softener), Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil, Benzisothiazolinone (Biodegradable Preservative)\n\nSample provided for review.","summary":"A great chem-free carpet cleaner that worked great for me simply using the bucket / sponge method ...","unixReviewTime":1454112000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1230"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-rrIWVH9L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61A4BkK4MTL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"6","verified":false,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2016","reviewerID":"A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ","asin":"B0187JBAGS","reviewerName":"PhotoGraphics","reviewText":"I like this dolly. Make no mistake; this is not a refrigerator dolly, or even a garden dolly. This is a convenience item with a strong emphasis on being light weight and compact over being a rugged workhorse. This is the dolly for a business person who picks up a couple of reams of paper from the membership club store and has to schlep it from their car to the storeroom. Its a back-saver for me for those weekly trips to buy a few cases of bottled water. It folds flat and opens VERY easy and is well suited to carting case-sized boxes around. On the downside are three notable cons:\n\n1. The wheels are small and narrow. They work fine on hard surfaced floors or commercial grade no-pile carpeting but bog down in any carpet with a deep pile and don't make for a very stable ride across uneven asphalt pavement like found in most parking lots. The wheels do ok over curbs but not for stairs. If you don't use a bungee (one is included) you're likely to be stopping every few feet to load your cargo back on the platform.\n\n2. The construction is light duty. Too much weight will bend or break the handles. If you have to tug hard to tilt it back to lift your cargo it's probably too heavy to haul on the cart.\n\n3. The price is out of line with competitive models that state a higher load capacity but have a lower selling price.\n\nI attached a couple of photos that give a little clearer look of the product. It seems the seller is using black & white pictures, the actual product is yellow, black and silver.\n\nAs I said I like this dolly for what it was designed for and I rate it as such because I find it handy, helpful and reasonably well made.

Until now, Ive stuck with the same 2 or 3 brands of filament that had received high recommendations from colleagues and online reviews.  Since there are so many brands on the market now, how will I know if the new (to me) names are as good as my tried-and-trues if I don't give them a go?\nThe IXCC white PLA Filament arrived quickly and well packaged.  The vacuum seal on the roll was nice and tight, with no leaks, so that was a good way to start!  As I unrolled the filament, it had the same look and feel as my other brands: smooth surface, fairly stiff and straight but with enough give to unroll evenly.  I took a few measurements with my caliper.  The filament should be 1.75 mm.  My readings were on the low end around 1.70 mm or 1.71 mm.  The expected tolerance is +- 0.05 mm so the filament just made it.  I have printed quite a few small items with it so far and am happy with its performance.  No gaps, no stringing, no air pockets.

With this ABS+, no ABS juice needed and I can print directly to the Kapton tape.  This filament sticks extremely well while the bed is hot, but amazingly easy to remove once the print has cooled completely.  I'm printing with my hotend at 250 and bed at 100.  Polishes nicely with acetone if desired just like plain ABS.

I mean, my printing time is 20 days and 10 hours.  Has it been perfect? No.  I've had a couple of clogs that required taking the extruder servo / fan off.  I've had to clean the nozzle a few times.  I've had to re-level the bed here and there.  But for the price I paid it's been amazing.  If you're willing to LEARN about the machine and how to take care of it, it'll be fine for you.  I print mostly with PLA, but I've done some PETG and a little bit of ninja-flex.  All of which has turned out great.\n\nI haven't run in to the problem others have mentioned with their power supply, but I'm keeping an eye on it. I figure if it were going to go, it probably would have by now.  Also since buying it I've installed the Swiss Micro all metal hotend for the MK10 type extruder and that's been awesome. Another thing I did that I think is very beneficial is I made a wood platform for it that I strapped it down to (with printed braces, of course!) and a vertical board attached to the mount surface to keep the tower nice and rigid.\n\nBottom line is that I very strongly recommend this printer for anyone who wants to get in to the hobby and isn't afraid to take a few screws off to troubleshoot the machine.

First was very noticeable and I did everything I could to put a bandaid on it but I couldn't do it. Second wasn't as noticeable until I started playing with settings and noticed an area where the lines got thicker than the rest of the plate.\nBent rods - The Y rods on the first one were bent and out of alignment causing the bearings to be bad as well.\nAlignment of rods - Both printers had they Y and Z axis out of alignment and I had to adjust them. After you do this once it's not so bad but still a pain.\nBearings - Holy hell have 4-6 on hand to replace these with as 75% of the time you get bad bearings so where on the machine.\nSpool holder - I've only came across one brand of filament so far that fits well on the original spool holder and the filament was terrible. You'll be printing one ASAP to add length.\n\nSummary - I know there's a lot of things I hate but even after seeing all that myself I'd still buy it again. The only thing I would do differently is, I'd buy all the extra parts needed at the same time as the printer.  Buy the Carriage plate drilled with the 4 guides for the Wanhao style i3. Buy 6 bearings to replace the 6 on the machine. Buy some hardened rods in case you get one with bad rod, or they bend over time, because eventually they will. There's also a Mosfet upgrade that needs to be done to the machine that costs maybe 20 bucks, I've not done it yet but I plan on it in the next week or 2.\n\n3D printing isn't plug and play, you have to be a tinkerer.

The 3 meter length and compact screen/power unit is simple and versatile, much better than 'gun' type borescopes in my opinion.\n\nI like that you can use a standard microUSB cable for charging, and if I ever need to replace or upgrade the rechargeable battery, it's a standard 18650 cell in a compartment accessed simply by opening a screw- I wish more electronics had such accessible batteries! You will also need a standard microSD memory card.\n\nMy only complaint is the same one I have with every borescope I've seen- the built-in LED light is far too weak. I use this as an energy auditor to inspect roof cavities, inside of walls, etc. Sometimes the light is enough, if the camera is very close to what you're looking at. But for use in a large open space such as a roof cavity, I've modified this by zip-tying a small but bright (130 lumen) AAA flashlight (see photos). I've done this same modification to another borescope at my last job.. I'd much rather pay more for a borescope with a brighter integrated light, since my modification about triples the head diameter, though I can remove the light if I need to. But I don't hold that against this product, since as far as I can tell, every borescope on the market has this issue.\n\nIt comes well packed, and even with clear instructions. The padded box it comes in is nice enough to keep and use for storage and transport, but a more compact and convenient solution is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/AmazonBasics-Fixed-Zoom-Compact-System-Camera-Case/dp/B00CHT6CRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">AmazonBasics Fixed Zoom/Compact System Camera Case</a>, which fits this borescope and all the accessories pretty much perfectly.

I've looked at many flashlight options (I'm a bit of a flashaholic..), and this is currently the best I've found for this purpose (and a bargain, considering the quality, size, and output).\n\nSo in summary: Buy this borescope, a microSD card (if you don't have an extra one lying around), the Amazon case, a set of spade bits, and a bright AAA light, and you will have the perfect borescope kit for less than even the cheapest model of one of the more 'professional' or well-known brands. I'm the kind of person who believes you get what you pay for, and usually I'll spend more for quality tools, but in this case, you probably won't get better quality by spending more (unless you go really high end, as in $1,000+..)","summary":"Surprisingly great borescope","unixReviewTime":1460160000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1246"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IM9eV8cVL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"07 19, 2018","reviewerID":"A1N03A4M6T4BCI","asin":"B018ITTFDM","reviewerName":"Dr. Roger L.

Albertson","reviewText":"This is a kit of parts, not a 3D printer.  It takes several hours to assemble the printer.  The instructions are good enough.  The parts seemed to be good at first but as I assembled the printer I found some defects.\n1) One of the guide bars had some deep grinder or  machine tool marks so the bearing did not slide smoothly.  I'd say about 1mm deep in multiple places along a 10mm length of the bar. (See photo)\n2) One of the four linear bearings was broken, loose balls and non-round hole.  Would only \"slide\" over a bar if force where applied.  They should glide with very little friction.\n3) there was a dead-spot on the LCD.  The LCD screen works fine except for a 5 x 30 mm box near the top. (See photo)  I can still use the menu system, just can read part of the screen.\n4) A short on the main board prevents use of the z-limit switch.  The switch itself is fine.  The main board works except for this one problem. (I was able to repair it.  It was a solder bridge under one of those micro size surface mount capacitors)\n\nThe seller does respond to emails quickly when I use the Amazon web interface to send messages.  Replacement parts however use a slow shipping method from China (not Prime shipping)\nI will update this review as I receive replacement parts.\nI was able to assemble the printer with the 3 good bearings and defective rod, the Y axis wobbles but replacement parts will fix this.  The electronics works, and I can guess what is printed on the defective part of the screen.  But the inability to home the z-axis means I have to turn the motor by hand and listen for the switch to click then edit out the auto-home command from the g-code file I want to pint.  Quite a lot of effort to make a test print on a wobbly bed.\n\nUPDATE:  All four replacement parts arrived. (main board, LCDD, Y-Axis rod, Linear bearing)  As I type this I have just used my first spool of filament and the results are good.  You MUST check and level the bed if needed EVERY print.  When using the sample PLA filament supplied with the kit set the bed fo 60C and the nozzle to 215C print at 60mm/sec but the first player at 30mm/sec or slower.  use LOTS of glue stick on the aluminum bed.  Correct nozzle height:  Find thin paper, high quality inkjet printer paper is why to thick, place it between nozzle and build plate, You should just be able to slide the paper with friction.  You need about 0.01 mm gap.\n\nI am getting good quality prints but.  It is not automatic.  You must pay attention to every detail and experiment with the setting in your slicer app.  Keep good notes about what works and what does not.  This printer is capable of very good prints but requires much car and attention and adjustment\n\nI added photos of parts I made, three are printer upgrades and one is a robot \"gripper\".\n\nI gave 2 rather than 1 star because the kit is still a good value and I have faith the issues might be resolved eventually (it might take a month).  I can change to 4 stars if this is resolved.","summary":"Good value, well designed but many defective parts, still waiting for replacement parts.  UPDATE: Parts arrived.

I like ir BUT...\nOriginal post was 5 star, but there is a recently discovered design flaw after four months heavy operation.\n\nOutstanding bang for the buck if you are a competent builder I am 70 years old and have been assembling kits for 60 years. This took me 15 hours to assemble and get operating. I had no need to call support or test any of those types of service so I can't rate that aspect. This is not a \"HeathKit\" instruction set if you know their style. Google it and see.\n\nVery complete set of parts and includes tools and spare hardware. Dropping one of the tiny nuts which disappears into dark outer space corner is not a game ender. Laser cut acrylic is outstanding quality. Yes, the \"wood finish\" on the acrylic is protective and needs to be peeled off. Probably one of the hard things to do but just part of the build. Tools are reasonable quality but I also used a few tools of my own. Pocket knife, etc.\n\nInstructions are minimalist but valuable. I viewed the video (which does match my machine) before purchase.[...] This is a new updated version of this printer. If this intimidates, do not purchase the kit. If you have all thumbs, do not buy because of the low price. Things like end switch lever position are hard to ascertain but can be seen in different views. The kit build in the video is not sequential as sometimes assembled parts appear early (like the Z stepper motors) before assembly is shown later. Exploded views would be nice too but I take the cost into consideration. None of this derates MY opinion. Certainly important negatives to others. I wish my 70 year old fingers were as fast as in the video... :)\n\nThere is NO Printing INFORMATION other than a video for leveling the bed on how to do 3D printing. this is an open source RepRap style machine. Other software will run this machine. No operational information included in kit. A course in 3D printing will need to be obtained elsewhere, like from the software provider. Honestly, this is a good low cost open source XYZ machine. There are better hardware designs as I consider belt drive minimal. I have rated this kit and not the design. For the investment MY opinion is it is a great way for an experienced builder like me to get started in 3D printing at lowest cost.\n\nThe low sound level is comforting. I have three CNC milling machines in my shop (I also built) and this machine is no worse that a standard office printer. The side material cooling fan that discharges under the nozzle makes the most sound and I have not yet discovered if I can control it with software. It runs continuous.

It took me quite a while searching to find the right ones, and let me tell you the criteria I discovered matters:\n\n1. Glass that is actually blue vs just painted blue. Yep, found many that were just painted flaky fading blue. These are actually blue glass.\n2. Length of droppers. MANY that I first considered had droppers that only went hardly past the halfway point. Garbage! These ones have a dropper that goes all the way down to the bottom and can be wiggled around to get every last drop.\n3. Leak-proofage. Many apparently leak, and these don't, at all. Did plenty of tests... filled the dropper, pushed and pulled at it, even sideways, while upside down... no leaks at all in any of the 8 that I've filled so far.\n4. Regular sealed lids included? These ones don't. These only have droppers. Some also include a set of regular caps but they were more expensive so I stuck with these. I'm working with mostly carrier oils, so it's totally fine to leave the dropper lid in there at all times. With harsh (real) essential oils, the rubber dropper might interact badly with the oils. It just depends. But I'm happy with these for me. It was definitely worth the savings.\n\nThey look great and impressive! My oil is a bit golden yellow so it caused a green tint in the light. That looked pretty cool and I was happy to present them to the few people I gave them to. (Btw... my cuticle oil recipe: unmeasured lots of silky jojoba oil, a bit of grapeseed oil, a little bit of sweet almond oil, a littler bit of avocado oil... and a little bit of lemon essential oil for the scent and shine).","summary":"Droppers go all the way to the bottom","unixReviewTime":1464566400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1276"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+gASHITOL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"3","verified":true,"reviewTime":"02 28, 2016","reviewerID":"A233263K5Q66L8","asin":"B018Y7NJ08","style":{"Size:":" 100 pack"},"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","reviewText":"These 15.1mm x 10.1mm +/- 0.5mm M5 T-Nuts are just like advertised!!

My boyfriend's foot slipped off one of the ladder rungs when he was about 18ft in the air despite wearing appropriate shoes and being careful. (He even has a lot of experience with climbing ladders after years of helping his dad with various construction projects.) Needless to say nobody is getting back on that ladder until my safety-proofing attempts are complete (this tape on every rung). My plan (not yet finished - see below) is to cut each strip in half vertically to make 2\" x 12\" safety strips, which will cover the majority of each rung. (I also implemented a new rule: no ladder use unless a second, responsible person is present to hold the ladder & ensure that it is stable.)\n\nI felt that the quality of each strip was good based on similar/comparable products at local home improvement stores. The grit feels very thick and coarse, and it should last through an extensive number of supervised ladder uses. I have a pair of very heavy-duty kitchen shears that work well to cut through the strips, too. (Smaller everyday or desks scissors would really have a tough time trying to cut through the strips.)\n\nHowever, each set of strips is packaged in a \"rolled up\" bundle, and the bundle seemed to be very resistant to straightening, which is certainly not conducive to proper application. (This is the main reason behind my 4-Star rating rather than 5stars.) My other main suggestion to the seller/manufacturer would be to add measurement markings in a standard grid format so that making straighter.  Currently, the backings to the strips are all plain white paper.  As of now, I've had the strips laying flat on my kitchen floor with stacks of textbooks sitting on top of them for about 3 days. The strips are now almost complete flat - I'll give them a few more days and then install maybe this weekend. Over, I do still think that this is a good product and safety measure.\n*Complementary product received from seller for testing and review purposes.","summary":"Great Product w/ 2 Minor Flaws","unixReviewTime":1465516800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1278"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lc2a9vVbL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ACPMINIgL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YJGI3CsIL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CJSEVUUUL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81k9d4tpcRL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Yf1lGHEYL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"6","verified":true,"reviewTime":"03 1, 2016","reviewerID":"A233263K5Q66L8","asin":"B0192F97J8","style":{"Size:":" 25 Pack"},"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","reviewText":"I ordered 25  Cast Corner Brackets for 20mm rails and received 25ish, and I am say \"ish\" because, 23 are visibly ok, and 2 have what looks like cold spots introduced during the casting process.

At the selling price at time the review was written of just over one hundred dollars, it is overpriced. There is a PowerSmith ash vac that is virtually identical selling for about $30 less that comes with more accessories and has over 1200 reviews.  This product is not worth the asking price which is the main reason it only earns 4-stars.\n\n2. The hose is only 3  that is a problem for a product designed to clean ashes. If I place it on the floor in front of my fireplace the hose has to reach over the hearth and all the way to the rear of the firepit. That distance is between 4-5. And to clean the ash from my kettle barbecue the distance from the ground to the bottom of the kettle bowl is over 5. I would have to lift the entire vacuum and hold it in the air to reach inside my barbecue.\n\n3. It only comes with ONE tool (a crevice tool with a very large open end). There is no reason this should not be a multi-purpose vacuum but the seller has targeted as something designed for ashes only. Thats a lot of money to spend for a dedicated ash vac that offers no other special features over a standard shop vac\n\n4. The LED hose is fluff. If you expected it to be powered from the vacuum you would be wrong, it gets its power from tiny hearing-aid batteries inside the wand. The light is located where the hose connects to the wand extensions and any light that gets thrown onto the work is insignificant and useless; the LED feature is nothing more than a gimmick.\n\nTHE PLUS SIDE\n\nThis vac is not without its virtues though. For one, the tank is all metal and the ashes are deposited directly into the tank, not a bag or any kind of removable container. That does require that the entire vac be lifted and dumped into the trash (which may be a bit of a challenge for some people because it can get quite heavy once full of ashes) but I would say it is relatively easy to clean. After dumping the ashes the container can be brushed out with a soft duster-type wand. I also like that the nozzle and its extension are made of aluminum so if they do come in contact with ashes that are still warm they won't melt.\n\nThe hose has a non-crush spiral spring inside, another plus feature. And the hose twist-locks into the canister so it won't pull out during use. These are all reasons this product was rated generally positively (Amazon defines I like it as a 4-star product)\n\nThe replaceable filter appears to be a different size than other models used by the same company and does not appear to be readily available. Based on the price of other filters sold by this company though you could buy a whole new vacuum at the hardware store for about the same price. Compare that to the PowerSmith which uses a washable filter, keeping the overall cost of ownership down.\n\nAll things considered the biggest concern about this product (other than being overpriced) is the too-short hose which cant be extended. That plus the metal canister can get quite heavy and must be lifted and turned upside down to empty it. There are no handles to grab it or hold it so you end up having to wrap your arms around the whole canister or grab the plastic wheels which can pull out of their sockets.\n\nArmed with these points to consider I hope this evaluation has been helpful.  A dedicated ash vac as a nice (but not mandatory) accessory to own but I would put its real-life value closer to about $50-60 rather than over $100.","summary":"Several important things to consider","unixReviewTime":1451520000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1282"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vHCe9dOYL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JIk3TQmlL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tPNTODMnL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g35aPYkiL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"9","verified":false,"reviewTime":"04 14, 2016","reviewerID":"A33QKO32NYS1IX","asin":"B0198H8JB2","style":{"Color:":" new2018-2"},"reviewerName":"Matthew","reviewText":"I've owned a lot of tape measures in my life, which have ranged in quality from the free ones they give away at Harbor Freight to fairly expensive stainless steel Stanley tape measures.\n\nOut of all of them, this is my new favorite.  It is by far the heaviest tape measure I have ever owned.  The case is fairly rugged plastic but the extra weight is from the tape itself- it is at least twice as thick as the tapes in my other tape measures.  It is also more rigid when extended-- I was able to extend this tape measure over 7 feet without the tape folding over or bending.\n\nThis tape measure also has three other features that aren't seen on most other tape measures.  First, there are two strong magnets on the foot of the tape that hold it in place against any magnetic surface.\n\nSecond, when you pull the tape out, it automatically stays in position until you push the button atop the tape measure to retract it.  Most of the other tape measures I have used  required me to depress a button to \"lock\" the tape in place after I'd pulled it out.  That this one automatically locks the tape to wherever you've pulled it and then waits for you to push a button to retract the tape makes much more sense and makes it easier to use this tape measure when you have something else in your hands.  Also there is no risk of the \"lock\" button slipping and causing the tape to retract just as you are marking your measurements.\n\nThird, the measurement markings on this tape measure are more clear than on most and, when set against a precision straight edge, appeared to be slightly more accurate.  I don't tend to use a tape measure when needing extremely precise measurements but having a more accurate tape measure has to be a good thing.\n\nDespite its increased weight, this tape measure is the same size as my other 25' tapes.  It includes a belt clip on the back, which is pretty standard for tape measures.\n\nIronically, what makes this tape measure great is also its only shortcoming-- because this is noticeably heavier than other tape measures, it may not be the first choice if you will be doing a lot of measuring over your head.  For any other application, this will be my go-to tape.\n\nI received a discount on my purchase of this tape measure in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of it.  The opinions and observations I have shared are my own.","summary":"Heavy duty, built to last","unixReviewTime":1460592000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1283"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dGB2Hj65L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AIIXamDOL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81033aoJQkL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fhJYVNk0L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ltAweDgiL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"7","verified":false,"reviewTime":"04 17, 2016","reviewerID":"A38J352T8TIPMX","asin":"B0198H8JB2","style":{"Color:":" new2018-2"},"reviewerName":"GadgetClass","reviewText":"The tape measure is something that is quite hard to improve on.\nThe basic design has not changed much over the years. There are, however, some designs that work better than others.\nTo test this tape measure I put it up against a very similar spring action Stanley tape measure that I have been using for years and a relatively new Harbor Freight tape measure I got for free with a coupon.\n\n--Test Setup--\nStandard of Comparison:\n- A 1-2-3 block (accurate down to .0001\"): http://amzn.to/1r7eMXX\n\nProducts Tested:\n- This Trust Tape Measure: http://amzn.to/1r7dmwG\n- A Similar Stanley Tape: http://amzn.to/1SnRsB7\n- A Harbor Freight Tape: http://amzn.to/22FxyRy\n\n--Tests--\n- Inside Measurement (Butting the end of a tape up to an object):\n  The Trust tape and Stanley Tape Read Right on in this test. The Pittsburgh was a 32nd strong.\n- Outside Measurement (Hooking the tape onto the end of something)\n  The Trust tape was a little over a 32nd under in this test. This is the main reason why I'm subtracting a star. I think over time it might fall into place as it loosens up a bit, but out of the box it reads a little short on external measurements. The Pittsburgh also read a little short, but only a little under a 32nd. The Stanley was right on. It should be noted that the Stanley has been used and abused and may have developed a certain slack which lent to it's accuracy here.\n- Maximum Reach Test (How far can it extent supported only by the body)\n  The Trust has a heavy end with the wide hook with it's 2 big magnets on it. This caused it to lean down throughout the whole travel of its reach, however it extended a whole 7.5ft before collapsing. The Stanley did about 6.5ft, but again it has been abused and I'm sure it has many weak points along it's reach. The Pittsburgh gave only about 6'2\".\n\n--Marking Comparison--\n- Trust: 32nd marks on both sides without any extra fraction or other markings to distract the eye. Inches are marked between feet after the first foot. 16\" markings are red and easy to see. The tape is very simple and clean. I think this does it justice. All of the info is there on both sides and is simple and easy to read.\n- Stanley: Has only 16th inch marks on both sides(No 32nds). Fractions are marked on one side but I never looked at those markings and I think they kind of distract the eye. Inch increments after the first foot are missing. 16\" centers are clearly marked in red.\n- Pittsburgh: 16ths on one side and 32nds on the other along with fractional depictions. Fairly clean and easy to read with inch markings between ft after the first ft. 16\" markings are small with just red letters and not as easy to see as the other 2.\n\n--Conclusion--\n  Despite reading a little shy on outside measurements, I think this is a good overall tape measure. I think as it breaks in and ages those readings will fall closer into place. I love the smooth nylon coating. It gives it a nice feel and keeps it from reflecting light. It will probably also help keep the blade from rusting and scratching and keep the markings good. The extra wide hook with magnets is both a good thing and a bad thing. Good in that it is easy to catch and grab things, bad in that it adds a substantial amount of weight to the end, reducing reach. I would love to see how far a non-magnetic one could reach. I only subtracted a star because of the reading slightly shy on external measurements. a 32nd isn't going to mess you up in 99.9% of jobs. This tape will replace my Stanley in my tool belt.","summary":"Pretty Good Design.

I really like their products compared to some of the others I have seen and/or purchased.\n\nThe printer arrived in a nice heavy corrugated box inside of a padded amazon box.  Upon opening the box, everything was packaged in thick foam that looked just like the photo on the item page.  Everything was well protected.\n\nThe first thing I noticed in unpacking the box was a nice card stock Kossel product manual.  The included manual is head and shoulders above what I've gotten with other DIY kits.  The images were nice and clear and in color.  Everything about assembly was well detailed and it appears they had someone with English as their first language write it up to the point where you install the electronics.  Even then it was still easily understandable.\n\nThe plastic parts are injection molded instead of printed with the exception of the print blower nozzle.  All parts went together very well with no gaps or struggles to assemble them.  There's extras of most of the hardware included. The only hard part of the assembly is installing the motors in the frame (my advice, install the motors before you install the 20x20 aluminum extrusions).  Everything else is easy. If you can turn a wrench and follow instructions you can put this kit together.  This kit took a little longer to put together than the pulley version but it was still an easy build.  I would recommend getting some good 12\" calipers and a nice set of hex wrenches.  The wrenches included are adequate, but it was much easier this build having bought a magnetic ball end set.  Measure and set everything like the end stop mounting blocks to the dimensions in the manual as accurately as possible to make calibration simpler. I would also measure the carbon fiber diagonal rods before installation too.  Mine were actually 2mm longer than what they were set at in the firmware.  This really helps with the flatness when printing.\n\nThe motors are better quality than the NEMA 17's that have come with other kits I've bought and the stepper wires are not hardwired into the motor for a change.  The item description says to download the driver, firmware and software from their google drive.  The board I received had a sticker on the anti-static bag stating the firmware had been uploaded (it had been).  The included SD card had all the software loaded on it, as well as pretty much any info you'd want know about the printer in .PDF documents.  The website does have the Marlin firmware from 02/28/2017 included in that package if you know what you're doing and want to use that release instead.\n\nUpon commissioning the printer, I ran the bed level test and it was almost perfectly level.  After a little tweaking, this has probably become my favorite printer to use.  All in all, I am very happy with this printer so far.  I feel it was well worth the price and a worthy addition to the growing printer farm.  The photo attached came off of this printer using Colido's wood PLA filament at 0.2mm resolution.  It can print at 0.06mm resolution as well if you need really fine detail and don't mind long print times.  I reprinted this a second time at 0.06mm and it took 16 hours, still faster than the 26 hours my reprap clone took though.\n\nUpdated 03/21/2017:\nI contacted Anycubic to inquire about purchasing the build surface that sticks to the glass bed since they are not listed anywhere.  They asked how many I would like to purchase and I responded three.  They came back with they are not available for sale as of now, but stated that they would send me three of them for free from China.  The next morning I received an email with a tracking for them and they are now in transit to me according to the USPS website.  Anycubic has been a great company to buy from so far.  No issues and the customer service has actually been helpful.\n\nUpdated 03/30/2017\nThe build surfaces arrived today as promised free of charge.","summary":"Great printer and great company to buy from","unixReviewTime":1489449600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1292"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DOMJlTu0L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IMMlcjnlL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"21","verified":true,"reviewTime":"11 22, 2016","reviewerID":"A3POI8I4CTZI8L","asin":"B019VSI9S6","style":{"Style:":" Linear Version-2"},"reviewerName":"Ramblin Dan","reviewText":"The accuracy of the Delta printer is very good. It prints with far less ringing than my Cartesian printer. Very impressive smoothness of the outer printed shell. The Delta prints much faster than the Cartesian. I have mentioned that before. Its all about the mass and inertia thing. Less weight moving means faster and smoother printing.\n\nOn this Delta, the print surface is 200mm in diameter. The printing area is claimed in writing to be 180mm diameter. Thats 10mm short of the outside edge. The measured maximum round printing area is only 140mm when built following the kit instructions. (See pictures) There is a design problem.\n\nI discovered the problem when I could not print a 120 x120mm box with a corner diagonal dimension near 155mm flat on the bed of the printer. An axis trolley hits the stop at the bottom of its column.\n\nThe reality is the available print area is NOT a round circle. The tern \"diameter\" led me to believe the 180mm printable area was round. Not true. It's a \"puffed\"-up delta area. The corners of this delta do reach to within 10mm of the edge at the columns, but the sides are 30mm from the edge. (see pictures) The effective ROUND printing area is ~140mm.  200mm - (30mm x 2) = 140mm\n\nI first thought I need to lower all three of the existing side rails by about 35-40mm. That requires loosening all the rail and end stop bolts and sliding them all down the proper distance. Then I may get the 180mm claimed base print area without hitting the bottom stops. I am concerned as the print head already hits the axis drive belts as it is now. It would be disastrous if the print area is expanded more.\n\nThe software print limit needs to be set to 140mm (round) printable area. The largest  Square that can be printed is 99mm on a side.\n\nBut for now, it sure does print nicely in its 140mm sweet zone in the middle. The overall diameter of the print bed is marketing hyperbole. The important information is the size of the printable area. Depending on the printer design or in this case, an engineering decision, it can be far less than the bed diameter.\n\nIt can be noted as the Z height increases off the bed, the trolley can use the gained space from the stop and widen the print zone above the base without hitting the stop.\n\nI had a bigger (300mm) version of a delta printer on my desire list but it was three times the cost of the 180/200mm version I chose. Its claimed print area is the same 300mm as its base diameter. I assume its printing area is also a puffed delta.\n\nNo big deal. The Cartesian can do the bigger projects and the knowledge from using, and nice printing of the Delta is an excellent experience. Just what I was looking for with the costs involved.\n\nNow that I am smarter about Delta style printers I can see the better geometry design features in the larger machine I was investigating. It has much longer arms to the print head. Proportionally more than would be required just because of the larger print area. The outer edge of the print area is not close to the corner towers. Much better design thinking and print surface positioning.\n\nThere is a big difference in sound level between my two printers. The Cartesian is (now) almost silent in its operation. It has become quitter the more it has run. The Delta has significant whine as it is operating. Its too soon to say it may quite down with use. The linear glides are not the noise. It is the constant high speed operation of the stepper motors but it seems mostly to be coming from the extruder. Slowing the movement may abate the noise level of the whining, but then that is losing the advantage of the high-speed movement the Delta can manage.\n\nIts the old adage, You pays your money and make your choice. The more you want or need, the more it is going to cost. Right now, I have all I need and I am not complaining. Just sharing the knowledge gained from hands-on experience.","summary":"Not exactly as advertised","unixReviewTime":1479772800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1293"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CRLZFoZ3L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"5","verified":true,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2017","reviewerID":"A2D5QSO9TBF3HI","asin":"B019W5T4CS","reviewerName":"Niviticus","reviewText":"I read a review stating they had received a set that would not stand straight, but figured that was over 6 months ago.

I've been very pleased so far, but have found some things that I hope may be helpful to first timers and maybe some more experienced users. I'll put highlights at the top and the details for those who want more as this has turned into a long review...\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n+Setup is simple. Just follow the simple directions to remove the battery tag and the cardboard in the dust bin compartment. (I missed the latter at first - oops). iRobot has a great support center on their web site with manuals, FAQ's and helpful videos to show how to use the Roomba 800 series.\n+The Roomba seems to use the \"drunken sailor\" method of covering the floor.  There was no obvious pattern to me in how it moved around a room. There was one corner it seemed to really like and it's probably the cleanest it's ever been!\n+I did not use the virtual wall other than for a quick test. it worked perfectly and was respect by the Roomba.\n+The Roomba is quiet for a vacuum but noisy enough to wake me from sleep. I have a small home and sleep on the main floor. I like my bedroom door to stay open. With the door closed or sleeping further away I expect this would not be a problem. I will probably get used to it.\n+The Roomba needs periodic maintenance beyond emptying the dust bin. This is important and iRobot brand parts are not inexpensive, but 3rd party parts are available for much less.\n+Compared to the 50% more expensive 880 package I think the 860 is a better value.  I don't feel the need for a remote and don't need the virtual walls. If those are important to you, then it's probably better than getting these accessories separately.\n\nBottom Line: The Roomba 800 series (based on dust bin contents) cleans better than my upright. That may be from going places my upright cannot. Easy setup, scheduling, and automatic operation help keep my floor cleaner than depending on me and my upright vacuum.  Maintenance is needed for continued good performance but is not onerous.\n\nFor The Detailed Review, Read On\n\nABOUT THE ROOMBA 860:\niRobot packages Roomba models based on included accessories. All Roomba robots in the 800 series are the same. The different \"models\" are different accessory sets. All include the docking station. The 860 also includes one dual-mode virtual wall to help contain your Roomba in your home and one spare HEPA filter.\n\nThe 880 model by comparison is the same Roomba but adds 2 virtual \"lighthouses\" , an extended life battery,  and a remote control to the 860 package.  It does not have the dual mode virtual-wall of the 860. It's $200 more than the 860 as of this review.\n\nThe Roomba requires regular maintenance and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/iRobot-kit/dp/B00P9XTVDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">iRobot kit</a>&nbsp;with 3 HEPA filters, 2 Brush sets, and 1 set of rollers is available on Amazon but is much less directly from iRobot. 3rd party kits are available on Amazon for much less.\n\nSETUP:\niRobot has VERY helpful information section on their irobot.com web site. You can find a quick start, detailed information, instructional videos (I liked these), FAQs, Manuals and other related information. I would have benefited from visiting the help center before setting up my Roomba. This is NOT to say setup is difficult: It's quite easy.\n\nHaving an engineering background I jumped in and winged the setup. I missed removing the cardboard from the dust bin before the first run. When I pulled out the bin, there it was, no harm done. Moral: at least look over the manual or the excellent support pages described above.\n\nFirst steps include setting up the docking station, pulling the battery tab, removing the cardboard from the dust bin, and setting it on the dock to charge fully.  Mine appeared to have about 3/4 charge out of the box. When I turned mine on with the center button I was prompted to set the time. Setting a cleaning schedule was just as easy after reading the instructions.\n\nOPERATION:\nSince this is my first robotic vacuum I was very curious how it would work. I used the center button to turn it on (after fully charged) and watched...\n\nThe Roomba wanders around my rooms like a very drunken sailor! It's kind of entertaining the first time. It did find its way out of every corner or cage of table legs eventually.  There is one corner the Roomba seemed to favor; a LOT.  I think it's the cleanest corner of my home! I have not seen any obvious sign or learning intelligence in how it meanders around the room. After watching for an hour I think it probably covered the whole floor.\n\nObstacles were handled  pretty well by the Roomba. It found its way out of every place it could get into. Sometimes this took a long time, but it did find a way out. Other obstacles like throw rugs were handled pretty well but sometimes got pushed up rather than be rolled onto. The Roomba treated these like furniture and just changed direction. I have not used my Roomba where it would be exposed to stairs or drops.\n\nOne thing that impressed and amused me is how the 800 series Roomba handles jams. I noticed it picking up a hair tie  and then a napkin. I thought \"Oh boy, now I learn how to clear a jam!\"  A few seconds later the Roomba \"threw-up\" the napkin and hair tie on the floor and moved on.  I didn't see that coming and was duly impressed. Well done iRobot!\n\nI so not feel the need for the remote control. If I'm going to spot cleaning I'll be picking up the Roomba anyway. Once a schedule is set I think I'll rarely change it. My expectation that with rare use I'd spend more time looking for the remote than  it would take to walk over and use the buttons on the Roomba.\n\nRESULTS:\nI have a smallish Electrolux upright and I have been very happy with. After using the Electrolux in another room I set the Roomba lose. I was impressed by how much it got compared to the Electrolux.  In the very best sense I think the Roomba really sucks and it cleans better than my upright.\n\nIt's important to regularly empty the dust bin of the Roomba. I know this sounds obvious, but I'm subject to the out-of-site/out-of-mind mindset. It's easy for me to forget to empty the dustbin and check the filter. The spinning brushes and rollers also require regular maintenance. Information on all this is in the manual as well as on the iRobot web site.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nI was first fascinated by the Roomba 860 when I got the chance to try it. After using it for a while I've come to like it quite a lot. It cleans better than my manual Electrolux and saves me time.  The $500 price seems expensive to me. But how much is it worth to get back that manual vacuuming time? Over a year or two I think it should be enough  to  seems a fair to good value on just that basis.\n\nThe Roomba has become enough of my home background that I don't think about it too much anymore. In fact I need to set reminders so I keep up with the maintenance and remember to empty the dust bin.\n\nThe Roomba 860 has been a time saver and cleans better than my trusty Elextrolux upright.  It's just a pretty cool new thing for a tech loving person like me and still simple enough for the non-techie. It's a very well done robotic vacuum refined by years of experience in the marketplace.  I am confident the Roomba will continue to improve.  This is a solid 5 star performance to me.","summary":"Easy To SETUP, Cleans Very Well, Self Clearing, Pay Attention To Maintenance","unixReviewTime":1459641600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1295"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717JGC0uBcL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"7","verified":true,"reviewTime":"04 8, 2017","reviewerID":"A1I6QWAKT2W2RQ","asin":"B01A6ORBGA","reviewerName":"Fred T.

We already have something like seven or eight pruning shears, ranging from heavy-duty and expensive to cheap and cheerful, and we try to keep them professionally sharpened.  With over a hundred roses (some huge climbers), they get a lot of use.\n\nWhen these secateurs arrived, I thought they looked small, but in use they perform like my heaviest, sturdiest ones.  The light weight and ergonomic profile are noticeable advantages after hours of continuous use.  The blade is extremely sharp and capable. I was surprised at the size of cane they can handle, both living wood and harder dead branches (easily 1 cm in diameter), although I will keep these strictly for fresh wood to avoid dulling the blade.  Also they cut cleanly instead of crushing. The blade metal seems to resist dirt and it's easy to wash the sap off it before storing.

That said, they can't compete with the much more expensive clippers I have (the brand that starts with an \"F\").\n\nThese are small clippers, which is a nice trait in some ways but not in others.  They fit in a back jeans pocket easily (although I'm not sure the manufacturer would want you to do that!).  They're sharper than a more expensive one I reviewed recently, and while they work well I see these as being my secondary rather than primary clippers.  However, those primary clippers cost considerably more, maybe three times as much, and as they're constantly being temporarily misplaced I like the idea of having an extra set or two that are less expensive alternatives at hand when I need them.  I can also use these for general work rather than wear out or damage my premium clippers.  These are the set to use when you need clippers you can jam into the the soil to cut roots!\n\nThe only design flaw I see is in the locking mechanism.  It locks nicely (on the right side of the clippers which is different than every other pair I've owned), but the lock tends to become engaged during use.  That is, whatever is being cut has a tendency to push the lock into the locked position.  That happens so frequently that I got into an automatic habit of using my thumb to unlock (or confirm that it is unlocked) after at least every two or three cuts.  That was a nuisance initially but now that it's became a habit I don't mind.  It is something that needs to be corrected by the manufacturer though.\n\nBottom line:  a nice, and nicely compact set of clippers that while not premium quality are a good bang for the buck.  As a secondary set, or to use for routine or tasks or those likely to damage your premium clippers, they're fine.\n\nI received these clippers in exchange for testing and writing this review.

The Anker HomeVac Duo is a great choice that I received at a discount for review and fits the bill pretty darn perfectly! It is essentially one of those hand-held dustbusters, but on steroids (much stronger suction, with reusable and washable filters, clear dust bin so you can see when to clean), and can be hooked onto the larger frame to make into an upright floor-vacuum! Numerous features on the vacuum cleaner make it extremely attractive:\n\n1) adjustable speed: both on the handle of the handheld vacuum AND the upright frame has a power button and a speed adjust button, so you can choose how strong a suction to use (easy maintenance of floor vs. dirty carpet). I love the fact the buttons are on both locations so you can use them no matter what mode you are in.\n\n2) The handle of the upright frame is foldable for easy storage. The floor module can also be removed for easy storage.\n\n3) You do NOT need to remove the handheld portion to charge it! The included charging stand, in fact, is designed specifically for use with the vacuum in its upright floor vacuum configuration. On the back of the vacuum is a small hook that will latch into the charging stand for stability. The charging stand has a tall backing to allow docking and holes/screws are also provided, should you decide to affix the charging stand against a wall. And the bottom of the charging stand has molded-in storage compartments for the 2 suction tips!\n\n4) The floor vacuum module can twist and turn to fit into tight spaces. There are also LEDs on the front of said module to illuminate the floor space being cleaned!\n\n5) Included suction tips, 2 of them, can be used with the handheld portion to get a wide area lane going, or to get into smaller areas.\n\nI ended up taking off one star for one major reason:\n\n1) I'm not sure if the model I received has a loose joint or something, but the floor module of the upright frame does not seem to want to stay locked in the perpendicular position, meaning 9 times out of 10 when I pick up the vacuum, the floor module slams straight down. The whole thing is light enough that I'm not worried about it damaging the floor, but I AM worried about it snapping the joint and rendering the upright frame inoperatble. Of course, this COULD have been a design feature to save on weight (as in to not have a stronger locking mechanism) but I would honestly sacrifice some weight to have the floor module lock into position more securely.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with this small yet powerful vacuum cleaner. Would certainly make cleaning up my cat's litter much easier without having to drag out the central-vac hoses!","summary":"The Anker HomeVac Duo is a great choice that I received at a discount for review ...","unixReviewTime":1466553600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1306"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mloH4O3zL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2016","reviewerID":"A3HXI1VWIV3QXW","asin":"B01AI10NQ6","reviewerName":"Nicholas Driscoll","reviewText":"I find this pH meter useful for different fermentation projects I have including brewing and vinegar making.

I was also curious to see what I could do with just the pen itself.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find it did, in fact, work with both ABS and PLA filaments and printed every filament I threw at it. It was easy to use as there's just a couple buttons to press to adjust speed. It certainly felt comfortable in my hand though it did feel a bit cheap. The description claims it's made of \"aircraft-grade aluminum\". I can't attest to it's actual construction as I've never handled aircraft-grade aluminum, but the 3D pen simply felt like plastic. This is subjective and I don't consider it worth subtracting a star for as the pen itself is very affordable. A couple other subjective cons; the USB cable is really short and, unless you have a power source close by, needs to be plugged into an extension cable. Also, the manual I received contained no English instructions but the device was easy enough to figure out without them just by looking at the Amazon page.\n\nIt was quite easy to use this pen to \"weld\" 3D-printed parts together by extruding the filament slowly and moving the pen in a circular motion; similar to actual welding. It also worked great for repairing pits, separating layers, and other minor imperfections in my 3D-printed parts. I've never used a 3D pen before but I found it easy to use and work with and was even able to make some \"artwork\" with it.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this pen. The only downside I found was that it felt like it was made of plastic but I hardly consider that much of a con due to the pen's price and the fact that it performs very well. I've attached some pictures of 3D prints I've repaired or modified with this pen, as well as a separate video review of the pen and a couple pieces of \"artwork\".","summary":"Easy to use, great for repairing 3D prints, and very affordable!","unixReviewTime":1519862400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1312"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mYnYN4RzL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610Zw8B-tBL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jrW8+VX1L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oUbnPVfoL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713oFnmLCXL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2017","reviewerID":"AT8TS7XTO8TIE","asin":"B01AP2DNVK","style":{"Color:":" 06a White 3d Pen"},"reviewerName":"AlmostEverything84","reviewText":"My Thoughts:\n\nWith the wave of 3D printers and I wanted to see what it was like to freehand 3D printing.

I tried in 5 degree increments from 190 to 230 and still no joy. The product might work on large flat surfaces but it is far too fibrous to work on any other surface. It does not do well with gaps and never evenly extrudes, I have used filled filaments before, everything from bronze and aluminum to wood, there is a trick usually to all of them to get the best out of it. I stopped trying to figure the trick out after 12 nasty looking prints, save your money and don't even try to go down that rabbit hole unless you are desperate for a large flat black cube that is surprisingly light and crazy expensive for what it is. Then this stuff is perfect. On to the quality issues. the diameter was spot on everywhere I tested it but you will need to rebuild your extruder drive system if you had setup to run TPU at some point. The brass feed teeth have a groove in them after very few uses and you would be better off with steel or at the very least have spares The steel extruder teeth that are best for this will cut the TPU but with withstand the abuse this filament puts them through. The spool however was junk, cardboard garbage that was made to look like you are getting a lot more than you are my spool weight was .41 kg upon arrival the cardboard must be 60+ grams so that means really you are getting .35 kg and a poorly wound .35 kg at that. It does produce a very cool look but it is not any stronger in my experience than PLA in fact in my tests the fibers run only one direction so if commonly failed at layer lines with 20 lbs of pressure on .5\" solid peg.

For those curious, these carts appear to be made in China through a company based in Minnesota.\n\nAlthough the instructions could be a bit better, the assembly is fairly easy with just a few bolts to attach the basket onto the frame and the handle and 4 pins to attach the tires.  Assembly took less than 10 to 15 minutes.  I don't particular like the cotter pins to attach the tires to the frame as I think they are easy to lose or break.  I would have preferred a more secure method.\n\nFor my use, I am using this cart in my yard that I would not consider to be rough terrain.  My biggest concern for the cart in rough terrain would be the tires that I can see being easily punctured in areas that have heavy thorns or sharp rocks.  For my yard, I am not concerned with that and this cart suits my purposes pretty well.  The cart is heavy duty for sure and weighs about 60 pounds but to my surprise it really does not feel like it as it is very easy to pull around and maneuver.  It has nearly a zero-turn radius and is very easy to turn around in tight spaces.  I loaded the cart full of dirt and found it still pretty easy to move around through the grass and soil.\n\nThe first thing that I do think needs to be added to these carts, I discovered after taking the first load of dirt to the back of my house which is down a slight decline.  The cart has no hand brake and can be difficult to stop or slow down when fully loaded going downhill.  For this price, a hand brake should be on these carts.\n\nThe cart release near the front handle is easy to use and allows you to easily lift the cart back for emptying.  The cart doesnt completely empty though and it would be nice if there was a back gate that assists in emptying of the cart instead of having to wiggle or shovel the remainder out.  This cart is supposed to have a 1-year warranty, but that is not clearly indicated on the instructions, packaging or the manufacturers website.

It certainly has adequate magnetic power to hold an indicator rigid, as designed. The bottom has a shallow V-block form, to hold onto round surfaces better, and the base can attach to flat surfaces by both bottom and back sides.\n\nI had been using an old push-button Starrett unit with rigid rods and a couple clamps, and this thing with its one-knob locking is a real joy to position by comparison. Once you have the notches in the rotating ball-joint collars turned the right way, it is very supple to position. Then tightening the one knob makes it all rigid as can be, comparable to my old Starrett. You want to support the indicator as you loosen the knob, because everything goes limp at once.\n\nThis base does not have any provision for holding indicators that mount by a small round stem. They say it will clamp a 3/8\" stem but I never had an indicator with such a fat stem. It clamps dial test indicators which mount with a dovetail rail, and works with both Mitutoyo and Peacock indicators that I have.\n\nAs a \"simple is best\" type of guy, I could have lived without the fine adjustment feature, as the overall ease of adjustment of this base (plus the dial-zeroing feature of my indicator) make it mostly unnecessary. But it does work well. I was surprised there is practically no sideways slop in the fine adjustment joint.\n\nI own a 3 inch milling vise made by HHIP about 15 years ago, and it is far sturdier and far better quality than another 3 inch vise I have with the Phase II label.

For those cases I do have a set of dial calipers that are accurate to a claimed .001 and don't require batteries. The problem is that they read in tenths and hundredths of an inch, and woodworkers like to work in fractions.\n\nThese calipers do read in fractions, as well as other user-selectable dimensions, which means they're handy for woodwork as well as for things like gauging guitar strings and more traditional machinists uses. It comes with a lithium button cell already loaded (you have to remove the insulating paper tab to activate it) and a spare, which is handy. I think itll be very useful in my home shop.","summary":"Easy to read, multiple measurement units, good quality","unixReviewTime":1523664000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1340"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vfkJNX5SL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bTuIPrfVL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Kb7cSYzWL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XGhXesCPL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6109V+SCjSL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"2","verified":false,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2016","reviewerID":"A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ","asin":"B01BPXJ290","style":{"Style:":" Dispenser"},"reviewerName":"PhotoGraphics","reviewText":"To me, aerosol air freshener cans are a necessary evil, with emphasis on the word evil.  My biggest dislike is that they either don't spray enough to cover the smell or they spray too much and overpower the room. And when you have numerous people using the guest room, like at a party, it can get pretty unpleasant in there after a while.  Plug-ins or any other type of continuous fresheners are usually worse because they don't know when to stop overpowering the room with scent.\n\nThis dispenser is designed for public rest rooms and its main feature is that it releases a microburst of scent at periodic intervals, so it never overwhelms.  Rubbermaid Commercial has had such products for many years; however the one being tested here is a new version not yet listed at their website that is fully powered by ambient light. There are  a wide variety of scent refills available and they are large cans compared to what you would usually buy for the home. The dispenser itself is designed to be 100% maintenance free (other than replacing the scent refill occasionally), it powers itself from the normal lighting in a bathroom using solar cells.\n\nNote that this dispenser is designed and intended for commercial use (as is made extremely clear in the product description).  Most of the reviews for it are from consumers who tried to use it in their homes.  A product like this would typically be installed by a contractor who has installed dozens, if not hundreds of them so there is zero need for a long, detailed instruction manual  once the trained installed has done it once they have no need for instructions.  Therefore, the inclusion of a simplistic instruction sheet that was not intended for consumers is NOT a negative or a reason to downrate the device, the only thing thats important is if it works and how it works.\n\nHow it works is an easy question to answer  right out of the box it is easy to figure out where the refill bottle goes and how to screw it to the wall (or use the self-adhesive pad if you prefer, both the pad and a set of screws in included). After that you just walk away and it does its thing and after the refill is empty it gives you a visual alert (there is also the option to have it beep at you, which I think would be extremely annoying in a home bathroom, but again, it was never designed to be used in a home bathroom).  There is also the option of setting how often it sprays the tiny microburst of fragrance, which was logical and easy to figure out  a lot easier than trying to program my microwave. Setup is made easier by a QR to a downloadable Android/iOS light meter app that is so good I decided to keep it on my phone for everyday use.  The unit requires a light level of 300 lux. A nice touch is that if you prefer not to have to use a key to open the unit for aerosol replacement you can replace the key lock with the included manual push button.\n\nIf it works is even easier to describe  it works like a charm.  I mounted it in my guest bathroom above the door so it wouldnt accidentally puff on someones clothes if they were standing too close (I found out that is extremely unlikely to happen).  It puffs just enough fragrance that the room maintains a consistently fresh smell 24/7 and the best part is that no one, not me and not my guests, have to do anything ever.\n\nWhile it should be understood by anyone considering this dispenser that it is NOT designed for home use (hence the word commercial in the product description) that option doesnt need to be ruled out completely. I would just suggest that for the typical home you set the puff rate at the minimum setting so it doesnt get carried away over-freshening your bathroom.\n\nSince this product is not designed for home use I rate it as an excellent choice for the restroom at your business, school or other commercial location. I chose to use it in my home which is technically not how it was intended to be used and when used PROPERLY I am very satisfied with it.","summary":"NOT designed for home use, but ","unixReviewTime":1470441600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1341"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xOi2J81hL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519EyK0RlOL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513DmZSv-uL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ii82k3mUL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hbpMwLSqL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hjU8yLn6L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":1,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2016","reviewerID":"A2RYWPOL4NN2KG","asin":"B01BPXJ290","style":{"Style:":" Dispenser"},"reviewerName":"Raed Haed","reviewText":"Well the only thing I can say about this product is that the person who created the instructions and the person who approved them should be fired.

The Simplify 3D program give me better quality prints.\nMy advice to you is to get rid of the damn brass head and PTFE tube if your printer has them. Upgrade to metal hotend and you won't regret it. I wish I had done this years ago. Here are a few items I printed with the new head at .20mm resolution. The top of the cap was at the bottom with the raft.

Over 15 years now, though I don't like to admit I'm getting that old. Guess I need to get over that cause I'm literally wearing bifocals for the first time ever today. They're actually pretty awesome :) I've actually brewed competitively off and on for a while and won a couple of medals for wines and meads. It's fair to say I know my way around brewing equipment and have seen more than my share of hydrometers over the years. When I was asked to review this one, I was happy to.\n\nTruthfully, maybe it's just because my local homebrew store hasn't updated what they carry since 1877, but this hydrometer is a breath of fresh air. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the color coding. Not only is this great for beginners, but even with my tired eyes the color coding helps a LOT. Why haven't they been color coded for years?!! The color coded sections are even labeled for \"beer start\" and finish \"wine start\" and finish.... such a simple addition but man would I have killed for that back in the days of my first couple of batches.\n\nAs you'll see from the photos this unit comes with a very nice case, which if you're new to brewing you might not appreciate but speaking as someone who's broken about 834 of these over the years, the case is NICE. Maybe this baby will stick around for a while in that case? I hope so. The top and bottom of the case have foam inserts and a little instructional handout which is very cool for beginners and awesome reference even for me. I actually giggled a little when I saw they also include a cloth to wipe it down. That's actually a very nice touch and in my mind sort of makes this the Mercedes-Benz of Hydrometers at a Honda price.\n\nYou will not be disappointed with this unit. Guaranteed. If you're not quite sure how to use one of these yet just get on youtube and look for How to use a Hydrometer. There are tons of tutorials out there.\n\nI received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

They are now fighting over who gets to use the 3Doodler Start pen, for several reasons- according to the kids (in my words):\n\nPros of 3Doodler-Start Pen:\n- internal usb re-chargeable battery; thus no need to have extra power cord sticking out the back and getting in the way\n- cool tip, no need to be extra careful\n- proprietary \"Eco-Plastic\" is softer after placing, and can be molded for a very short time by finger (cool enough and malleable enough to smooth out some surfaces, for example)\n-plastic is cool enough to even use directly on the provided paper book stencils- the Eco plastic does not stick to the pages of the book, and comes right off the paper!\n- less \"threading\" of filament when taking pen away from project\n- less jamming (very critical), so no need to have backwards button to remove filament for cleaning- it appears to have an auto clearing feature that moves the filament backwards and forwards to unstick.\n- one big ON button, and auto flow of filament, so you don't have to keep pressing the forward button to squeeze out plastic continuously as you work (slower flowrate, but they don't mind)\n-The silicon green circular molds provided in this Mega set are really easy to use, have a lot of useful shapes, and the finished products pop right out.\n\nCons:\n- you run out of filament quickly, because the provided strands are fairly short- about 6\"- exactly the length of a US dollar bill, and you have to keep replacing them into the pen, causing delays. also, one larger project uses up an entire pack of filaments- my son could not complete his (not so large) helicopter project (from the book), for example, and needed to change colors after going through all the red (he did say he used some of the red for his Eiffel tower, however). My daughter pointed out that her one dinosaur used 1/2 the pack of whites.\n-a negative to the melted Eco plastic not sticking on paper, is that it does not stick on paper!-- thus you can't use the paper to \"anchor\" a melted blob as easily, and the entire piece may lift up with the pen (but not a major problem)\n-several examples of projects in the book use colors not provided in this Mega set, which my daughter found annoying.\n\nThis pen and Mega set are great, hands down, esp. for kids, and the proprietary \"Eco\" plastic is very beneficial and superior in the several aspects covered above, as well as being non-toxic. Also, there is almost no smell from the melted Eco plastic, vs. when my kids use the PLA or ABS filaments for the Hatchbox pen (I usually open a window).  I deducted 1 star, because the cost for these great proprietary Eco plastic filaments is REALLY HIGH ($7.99 for one pack of 24-six inch pieces-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/3Doodler-Start-Eco-Plastic-Pack-Lemon-Zest-Lemon-Yellow/dp/B01J50A21M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">3Doodler Start Eco Plastic Pack: Lemon Zest (Lemon Yellow)</a>).\n\nThe Eco filaments for this 3Doodler -Start are much thicker than the standard 1.75 mm used by a lot of 3D pens, and i don't want to try using incompatible sizes in the 3Doodler-Start pen. Interestingly, on the 3Doodler-Start Eco filament pack, it says that these Eco plastic filaments are not even compatible with other 3Doodle pens like the 3Doodler 1.0, 2.0, Create, or Pro versions.  Perhaps this Eco-plastic filament pretty much only works with this one pen- the 3Doodler-Start.\n\nOur Hatchbox pen, which uses the standard 1.75mm filaments that a lot of 3D pens (and 3D desk printers) use, has options to purchase giant rolls of filament weighing 1 Kg (not sure of length cuz they sell by weight). See pic where i have our our glow-in-the-dark filament roll-&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/HATCHBOX-3D-PLA-1KG1-75-GLOW-PLA-3D-Printer-Filament-Dimensional-Accuracy-0-05-mm-1-kg-Spool-1-75-mm-Glow-in-the-Dark/dp/B00M0CS73S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">HATCHBOX 3D PLA-1KG1.75-GLOW PLA 3D Printer Filament, Dimensional Accuracy +/- 0.05 mm, 1 kg Spool, 1.75 mm, Glow in the Dark</a>&nbsp;priced at $23.99 shown next to an Eco pack) for comparison.  The pics below are projects my kids did from the book provided in this Mega set, except for the little green guy with antennae sitting next to the Eiffel Tower, which was previously made with PLA plastic and the Hatchbox pen.\n\nI'd say this pen is a 5 star for ease of use, good Eco-plastic and convenience, but a 3 star for cost and inconvenience of short pieces of proprietary plastic.","summary":"Best 3D Pen for Kids, Very Expensive Proprietary Plastic","unixReviewTime":1473552000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1368"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ItspdRnsL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xgzz0JpFL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eLhz7naPL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ck90OWp0L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71durlOF5QL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n1fFMZYDL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xt49zHhML._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ItspdRnsL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xgzz0JpFL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eLhz7naPL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ck90OWp0L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71durlOF5QL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n1fFMZYDL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xt49zHhML._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"3","verified":false,"reviewTime":"12 3, 2016","reviewerID":"AHRNDSKWH1YBT","asin":"B01CL1FFPK","style":{"Color:":" Powder Blue"},"reviewerName":"Hiawhatha","reviewText":"I have a love/ hate relationship with this toy. While I like the concept and it certainly is a good foray into all things 3D, it is super frustrating and not at all friendly to anyone who isn't extremely patient and artistically inclined.\n\nWe have a 3D printer and had an earlier version of this pen in 2014. That one had problems with the tip clogging and uneven heat. This one has much improved in those areas. We didn't have one clog the entire time we used it. There is a steady stream of filament coming out of the pen, as long as there is some going in.\n\nWhen first plugged in, the tip starts to heat. We laid it on cardboard on the table and waited. It was only a few minutes before the indicator light said it was ready. It took about 15 seconds before filament started coming out the first time. There are 2 speeds and we only used slow. Fast was kind of crazy and we hardly had the technique down to try and corral all that filament coming fast and furious. Luckily, the low speed was fine. I was continuously tempted to keep my finger pressing the button in order to make it start, but one press was enough. I would have rather gained some control by having a button that you held down in order to use it.\n\nThe pen itself is pretty and a lot less clunky than the previous version. It fits in my hand as well as my 9 year old's. He had a great time but got frustrated about 20 minutes in. My 13 year old art-focused daughter tried a little longer. More than anything, we all felt like we used ('wasted') too much filament. I can only imagine how much one would use for a normal sized project. I was tempted to see if my 3D Printer filament worked in this, too, just for kicks.\n\nThe pen tip was hot to the touch but the filament cooled almost instantly. I wouldn't give it to a rambunctious child, but even the most heat sensitive person wouldn't be hurt by the filament shortly after coming through the tip.\n\nSee the photos I have added to get an idea of what you can do with 30 minutes of practice.

You put the teeny plastic bar on the back and a little auger feeds the plastic stick into the unit at two speeds- slow or fast.  There is also high and low temp. The pack comes with 2 - 25 stick packs of plastic.  One is primary colors, the other is neon- both matte in texture and appearance.  It comes with a screwdriver if you need to remove the maintenance cover.  It also comes with a mini spanner for tightening and removing the nozzle.  There is also an unblocking tool.  That allows for you to unblock if the plastic should be stuck in the unit.\n\nThere is a great start up guide that comes with this 3D pen.  It is easy to follow and very thorough.\n\nThere are three types of plastics you can use with this.  There is flexy, for flexible plastic you can bend after you make something.  There is ABS which is matte and it is what comes with the kit.  They come in a variety of colors.  PLA is more of a specialty plastic.  It is glossy, metallic, or clear.  You use that at low temp.\n\nThe power cord is very short.  You might have to make sure you have an appropriate extension cord for this pen if you plan to use it in a classroom, or in an area away from an outlet.\n\nHOW DOES THIS PERFORM?\nThe tip of this gets VERY hot, so you have to be careful not to touch it.  Our daughter is a teen, so she is not a small child.  This is NOT a toy nor is it for children, but more for ages 13 and up with parental guidance.  It is a very specialized tool that needs care to operate.  This pen is easy to use, and will take a little time to get the hang of.\n\nIf you get this, you should keep in mind it is best to use a color you are not fond of to practice with.  This will give you a chance to learn the tool without wasting your favorite colors.  It is easy to use, but you have to figure out how to use it without it looking overly curly or amateur.  It takes  a LOT of practice to get as nice as the sample photos of things that you see on the promotional materials.\n\nIf you plan to use this a lot, it would be a good idea to have a full arsenal of colors and types of plastics to have on hand.  You can not use this for more than two hours, it has to rest, so whatever you do, plan on rest time.\n\nSometimes the plastic does curl around the top like a hot glue gun, but it shows how to deal with any possible problems very well in the instructions.\n\nYou can use templates for 2D objects tracing them on paper so that it is easier to be creative and look professional.\n\nWHAT TYPES OF USES WOULD THIS HAVE?\nThis is very useful in a variety of crafts such as :\nScrapbooking\n3D modeling\nMaking game pieces\nProjects for illustrations such a science projects or presentations\nOne of a kind art pieces\nJewelry (earrings, etc especially the Flexy)\nMany more for the creative mind to come up with.\n\nCONS?\nAt this point, there seems to be only one small thing about this that is a bit frustrating.  The plug goes into the pen and it is straight out from the pen.  The little plastic bar that goes into the unit is very close to the cord.  If the connector for the power cord had an angled swivel on it, that would make it a little easier to work with when the plastic tube is long on the back of the pen.  Then it would make it not tangle up as you use the pen.  It is not a deal breaker by any means, just a suggestion for improvement, perhaps.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nThis pen has given many many hours of creativity for my daughter and I, although she has it most of the time and won't let go of it. There are a whole host of projects you can do with this pen.  Having a full selection of plastic bars handy is essential if you plan to use this a lot.  The site is easy to get around, and the instructions are excellent.  This is a fantastic gift for yourself or someone else who is creative and loves to do all sorts of crafts.\n\nFIVE HUGE STARS at this time.  I plan to update this review as often as I can with more ideas and experiences we have had with this fantastic craft tool.\n\nPHOTOS\nI am including two photos with this review.\nFIRST PHOTO\nThe tip of the plastic bar when you are done using it if you don't finish the plastic bar and have to remove it.  There is a long end that has to be clipped off.\nSECOND PHOTO\n I am also going to show you a 2D object (peacock feather) that my daughter made as one of her first projects.  She used a template and did this on paper.  If you don't do this on paper, it will curl up and around the tip and make you frustrated.","summary":"This Year's BEST Gift Idea To Date In Our House!

It's fun, but has a finite color palette, so I wanted to try this one too. So far, I love it.  There is a lot to say, so I will break it down into pros & cons.\nPros:\nIt has a slim body, making it easier to handle.  Many of these have rather chunky bodies, so they are tiring to use for any length of time.\nIt has 2 heat settings, for PLA & ABS plastics.  Not all of these pens do.\nIt comes with a nice assortment of filament sticks, to start you off.\nThe company sells a wide array of colors and styles of filaments (including clear, opaque and metallic.)\nThe included instructions are very clear. (Do read them all the way through before you start.)\nThe company's website has loads of videos and project plans to teach you to use it and give you ideas. The site is www.the3doodler.com\nCons;\nThe filament can get jammed (but tools and instructions for unjamming are included.)  To be fair, I suspect this is true with other 3D pens, as well.\nIt takes 3mm sticks of filament, which means that you are best off using their product and there is only so much of it available in stores. ( I can get some colors at Michael's, but mostly I have to order it.)\n\nFinally, some suggestions;\nThe tip of this pen (or just about any, but the 3Doddler start, which is made for kids) gets rather hot.  So keep it away from your fingertips.\nAlso, plan to have a heat-tolerant surface where you can put it down, when you need to.  A silicone pot holder with do nicely.\nCheck out some of their accessories. I have found the Doodle Pad ( a plastic overlay) and the extra nozzle set especially useful.\nSpend some time with their basic instruction videos.  This takes some learning.\nThe fun is as limitless as imagination!","summary":"Fun tool for creativity!!","unixReviewTime":1479513600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1372"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ekxu8NRPL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KZtEEQ5FL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-DNYB+7vL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"11 14, 2016","reviewerID":"A35Q0RBM3YNQNF","asin":"B01CL1FFPK","style":{"Color:":" Butterscotch"},"reviewerName":"M. Hill","reviewText":"This is my first 3D doodler and it has a lot of potential for a variety of craft projects. The unit itself is straightforward to operate and the enclosed user guides are clearly written. Basically after plugging it in, slide the switch to the proper position based on the material being used. An LED light changes from red to blue (or green depending upon the filament selection). Insert one of the filaments until it encounters resistance and press the fast once to start the motor.\n\nI was most comfortable working at the slow speed, particularly while becoming accustomed to the process. I began playing with free-form squiggles which made interesting looking earrings. Wire was a material I used in the past to do something similar, and although this is completely different, the plastic is feather light so the earrings are very comfortable to wear and could certainly be made with beads or small charms attached and still maintain a reasonable weight.\n\nI used the pink and yellow filaments first because I liked them least for this purpose so they were good to employ as I learned how to use the device. There are many colors available for purchase separately  some muted shades that will be good choices for jewelry.\n\nNote that the filaments included with this doodler are basically primary colors. As a gauge to estimate how much can be done with a filament, to make the two pairs of earrings pictured, I used two hot pink filaments and one yellow.\n\nThe unit itself is similar in concept to a hot glue gun, only the motor drives the material, there are speed options and the device is more finely crafted and. The included AC adapter has a 6 foot cable which conveniently permits some distance from the outlet to the work area. The 2 1/2 x 1 inch wall wart portion of the cable, unlike most, is horizontal so it fits in either the top or bottom outlet without blocking the other opening.\n\nMy only small issue with the device is the odor from the melting plastic which reminds me of polymer clay that is baked in the oven. I assume it is not a good idea to breathe the fumes so use in a well-ventilated area.","summary":"3Doodler 3D Pen Butterscotch Color - Creative Tool for Crafting","unixReviewTime":1479081600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1373"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q10tySW6L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41fQOKC9ICL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/316OSYvXvRL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41G5Twm8uKL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41QZ+LNIJgL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"3","verified":false,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2016","reviewerID":"A3F9CMU8KNAY1M","asin":"B01CL1FFPK","style":{"Color:":" Shocking Pink"},"reviewerName":"Susan","reviewText":"I'm having fun with my pink 3Doodler Create 3D pen. I have a couple other 3D pens so kind of know how they work. This 3Doodler is easier to write with than my others and has thicker 3.0mm filament.\n\nThere is no LCD screen; you turn the switch from off to either hi or low and it heats up, which only takes a few seconds. Once the pen is at the temp then you can put filament in the end by twisting it a little until it gets to the mechanism that feeds the filament into the pen. There's two speeds; I normally use the slower speed except for when I'm filling in areas and then the higher speed works better. It comes with two packages of 25 10\" strands in multiple colors and there's plenty to create a few \"masterpieces\".\n\nIt's a little tricky at first to make something; the trickiest part for me is to make the base of whatever object I'm making. I've found that it's easier for me to move the pen in little circles. When you stop at the end of something there's always a little filament left over that's stringy that you can eventually cut off. So far what I've made mostly is birthday cards and wrote with the pen in them. I also used a stencil sheet to make different designs. I haven't done much drawing in the air yet.\n\nMy biggest con of this pen is the filament. The 3Doodler takes 3.0mm filament and only comes in short 10\" strands so you need to keep stopping to put more filament in. Plus the price is way higher than the 1.75mm filament. It would be nice if it used the same filament as other pens do.","summary":"Doodle something","unixReviewTime":1475366400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1374"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xSqd10E6L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DQkzyZLzL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61me0tJaxjL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"75","verified":true,"reviewTime":"08 3, 2016","reviewerID":"A3BU71N42M78V8","asin":"B01CNP3CUO","style":{"Size:":" A3"},"reviewerName":"Richard C.","reviewText":"Received this printer as a gift from my son who bought it here on Amazon. I am a tinkerer so the kit was the right choice. I thoroughly enjoyed the build. There are some minor discrepancies in instructions (screw sizes etc) and some missing instructions for some parts in the video but a little common sense gets you through the build. It is a sturdy piece of equipment after building and it has not been powered off for 3 weeks with me playing and building all sorts of things. I highly recommend this 3d printer to anyone looking to explore this hobby/rapid prototyping.\nI modified it some by adding a spool holder over it, and changed out the wingnuts for thumb wheels.

I contacted Anne at customer service, and she mailed me replacement parts, and shared component STL files so I could print a new set of x-axis parts that hold the z-axis bearings (one had split, when installing the 8mm smooth rod for the x-axis).\n\nThe second one was mostly assembled and went together in under 3 hours without a hitch and prints wonderfully.\n\nAfter receiving the second printer, it had some upgrades that the first one did not. I contacted Anne, and she sent me the STL file for the z-axis motor bases, and sent an upgraded 20Amp Power supply to replace the 15Amp power supply of the older version. This upgrade fixed the problem of the screen flickering while printing.\n\nOne of the two machines was to be used at an elementary school for a robotics club that I administer. I wanted the machine to be completely safe around the kids, so I developed some upgrades for the screen cover, and two covers that protect little fingers from getting into the drive pulley and belt pinch points on the y-axis (under the print bed).  See photos.\n\nI am able to get this printer to print at 120 mm/s with flawless prints in ABS, PLA, MakerFlex, Rapter (Maker'sGeek high temp PLA), Crystal PLA, Conductive, and wood. I have yet to try Nylon or Carbon Fiber, but I am sure it will print them just fine. The one functional upgrade I made to the machine was to replace the 214 x 214 x 1 mm thick aluminum base plate for the y-axis bearing mounting (qty:3) with a slightly larger and thicker piece ( 222 x 222 x 2 mm). I was finding that I had to re-adjust the bed leveling a lot as that thin aluminum plate was warping on the left side where there is only a single slide bearing. This was a very easy upgrade, as I used the original as a template to drill the holes for the thicker, larger plate. I am planning on adding a borosilicate glass print surface in a larger size and swapping out the 8mm smooth and threaded rods for the y-axis with longer ones to increase the build volume to 375 mm x 250 mm x 215mm. To make the x- axis bigger will only require moving the belt bearing farther to the right ( I plan on making it adjustable for easier belt tensioning). The z-axis enlargement consists of mounting the print head assembly higher on the x-axis carrier, then lowering the z-axis limit switch. One other upgrade I plan on making is to replace the 3mm Allen head bolts for the heated bed with bevel head bolts and counter sinking them into the surface so they will be flush on top. This will allow my glass build plate to make good thermal contact with the heated bed. I plan on securing the Glass Bed to the existing Hot Bed with magnets, for easy removal.\n\nI recommend lubricating all the linear bearings with light machine oil and cleaning the 8mm smooth rods, and ACME threaded rods regularly to remove debris so the bearings will slide smoothly and will not fail and the z-axis will move without restrictions.\n\nNote that the cover on the right side of the display screen includes a guide slot for making the insertion of the SD card a simple process. I plan on listing the files for these upgrades on thingiverse as soon as I can make time to get it done. (Update: This is now done... search for JGAurora on www. Thingiverse.com).\nI have also added a photo of about half of the parts I printed in under a week.","summary":"I am very happy with this inexpensive printer.","unixReviewTime":1515974400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1377"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dof3FbvhL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"07 29, 2017","reviewerID":"AR0DC6WQHKO57","asin":"B01CNP3CUO","style":{"Size:":" A3"},"reviewerName":"John R","reviewText":"Excellent Quality Prints.

3, 2016","reviewerID":"A1ZU55TM45Y2R8","asin":"B01CP183UA","style":{"Style:":" 3D Printer"},"reviewerName":"Jeremy Haggard","reviewText":"The Idea Builder 1.0 from Dremel was a pretty stellar product when it was first released because it worked and it worked well out of the box. For may, myself included this was our first time using a 3D printer. The Idea Builder 1.0 was the first 3D printer produced by Dremel, and as such it certainly had its problems and annoyances. Dremel listened to the feedback from their customers, in fact at one point I logged a support ticket on their site and later that night I had a conference call with one of their engineers to discuss a clogging issue with the print head and other gripes and Dremel appears to have compiled the feedback from not only me but other Idea Builder 1.0 owners into what they are now calling the next generation of Idea Builders, the 2.0\n\nAs an owner of the 1.0 and now the 2.0 I wanted to review the differences in these products and share my thoughts on them.\n\nFirst off the shipping of the 2.0 is similar to the 1.0, it comes very well packed inside an outer carton so you can have this shipped from Amazon to your home or office and no one will be the wiser what is inside. Simply remove the inner carton and you have the official Dremel box with full artwork. I will say the 1.0 did feature a nifty inner packing where when you removed the lid of the box the sides gave way and it was a display within the packaging which I liked, the 2.0 went for a simpler \"box\" approach which works just as well, just not as fancy.\n\nThe printer is nestled between 2 cardboard sleeves, simply open the top of the box, remove the 2 plastic envelopes which hold power cord, usb cable, build platform, build tape, directions,a usb drive, plastic \"removal tool\" (a.k.a putty knife.), etc and then lift out the top cardboard sleeve. You then pick the printer up, it is wrapped in plastic, take the bag off of the printer and you'll have more packaging to remove. Peel away the blue tape and pull off the plastic covers from the acrylic top and doors, don't forget the tape on the left side holding the filament storage shut. Once done open the front door and gently raise the build platform with your hands and then the last 2 cardboard inserts pop right out, the last insert you'll remove holds the spool of filament. Overall packaging is very minimal but very secure.\n\nThe printer has had some drastic changes from the 1.0. For instance the old printer had a lid that was Dremel blue in color and it lifted right off. The new lid is attached with hinges and is clear acrylic so you can see right into the printer, a pretty cool addition to ensure your printer remains protected yet visible. One thing I like is the hinges are not cheap, the lid will actually stay in an open position at almost any angle so it won't slam shut, a nice touch. It's also thick so it doesn't flex when you lift up on one side.\n\nThe front door also saw an improvement and is MUCH larger than the 1.0 door. It also feels stronger in build quality and doesn't flex at all when opened. There is a magnetic closure on the right hand side, part of this magnetic closure is a sensor that tells the printer if the door is open or not, if it is open the printer will still function but it throws a warning message on the little control panel. In fact when you hook the printer up to your online dremel account the website will give you near realtime feedback when you try to send a print to it reminding you the door is open.\n\nOne thing that I hated about the 1.0 was the filament path, on my printer the screw always comes loose and the filament channel would fall off causing the filament to jam or break, I would then  have to reattach it and then run the filament and feed it into the head again. The new 2.0 does away with that model and uses a simple clear sleeve up the left side of the printer, then the filament goes from that right into the print head. Very easy, no points of failure to fall of or break causing jams.\n\nNow one significant thing Dremel did differently on the 2.0 is completely revamped the spool loading. In the old version you put the spool on a little plastic adapter inside the printer, for me this meant raising the build platform to the top, opening the door and trying to get the spool situated. Now this wasn't always easy but it worked. And while the original printers spool holder was build for Dremel spools fellow makers were able to upload a file where you could print a replacement spool holder that fit most 3rd party spools. On the 2.0 however that is no more. Spools are now loaded through a round cover on the left side of the printer, you turn the cover counter-clockwise just a little to unlock it and remove the door. Then feed the filament through the plastic tube and insert the spool onto the mount, put the door back on and finish threading the filament into the print head. Overall I like the design better but I am not sure if 3rd party filaments will fit this new spool holder, and since it is a massive upgrade, replacing the filament holder won't be easy, but replacing the spool will be. They do make external filament roll holders, you can also print your own that would sit next to the printer so there is a way around using the onboard holder if you needed/wanted to.\n\nCalibration of the old 1.0 meant sliding a tiny piece of paper between the build platform and the print head until it was the right amount of tension. This annoyed me and I burned/melted more than one leveling sheet in the process. The new 2.0 has an upgraded self leveling system, sure you still need to adjust the dials but the printer auto calibrates and then tells you what to do, and when you are done. If it senses it isn't level it tells you what dial to turn and then as you turn it you hear a victory beep letting you know you succeeded, simply press the confirm button and the printer double checks your work and you are ready to print.\n\nThe new 2.0 also features one other major upgrade, WiFi and iOS and Android apps. I didn't test the iOS app but I did use the android and it is very slick. First off when you power the printer on it walks you through country selection and language followed by a EULA. Then it searches for your wifi and you use the touchscreen to enter your password. It's very intuitive. Once done you can download the app and register your printer, you do need to get a token from your printers settings menu to register the app but that is a few pushes on the touchscreen to generate that. After that you can link the account up to the dremel autocad app (all within the same app) and start printing directly from your phone, tablet or even computer wirelessly. I did test saving an STL file from thingverse and uploading it to my dremel account on their site and was able to to trigger a wireless print of an STL file I downloaded from another repository of files.\n\nMy initial print was a traffic barrel followed by some sunglasses that say \"SUSE\" (linux) across the frame, I logged into the app, sorted by print time and found a 12 minute print item and hit the print button. Nothing happened, I realized when I looked at the status in the app it told me my printer door was open, I shut it and about 20 seconds later printing started. The overall build quality was really good considering I just unboxed it, loaded the filament and calibrated it. I didn't tweak any other settings and am very happy with how the build went.  Later I printed a fully functional robot toy with hinges as well as a lighthouse that took over 6 hours to build with supports included, everything worked perfectly with no hiccups.\n\nOn board in the internal memory there are the typical Dremel standard prints, a frog, chess pieces, a t-rex head, etc if you want some quick prints without any external app. They produce excellent results, in fact all of the prints I downloaded from Dremels site directly have been very successful, they seem to vet those designs very carefully and ensure they are optimized for their printers. 3rd party download sites do work as well, but those are the ones where your mileage may vary.\n\nOverall the enhancements on the 2.0 are really nice, I dare say \"essential\" and compared to the 1.0 this is my new go-to printer. The fact I can print wirelessly and have a build queue makes this so much more efficient. Mix that with the new acrylic doors, spool loading process and clog free print head (something 1.0 did NOT have) I really like these changes and it shows Dremel really listened to it's customers.\n\nI will add, one feature missing from this is the heated print bed. The 1.0 didn't have it either but other printers of comparable cost DO feature this. I have not needed that yet and all my builds on the 1.0 turned out good, and so far the initial prints on the 2.0 are even better. There are aftermarket heated beds you can install if you want that, perhaps Dremel will add that and a second filament spool and extruder on the next version. But for now I would say the enhancements on 2.0 make this a worthy contender.","summary":"What happens if you take the annoyances of the 1.0 and listen to your customers?

Let me start off by saying Im a novice to the world of 3D printing and only stumbled upon it while clicking around on YouTube.  After watching a few videos I was hooked and wanted to buy a printer of my own.  I searched and searched and then search some more, over-analyzing every type and price point of 3D printer on the market.  I looked at $150 DIY kits and $1500+ fully assembled and ready to print machines.  After weeks of research I knew I wanted a machine that was under $1000, had a heated bed for the ability to print a variety of filaments and at least partially assembled.  That brings me to the QIDI line of printers.  Although these printers had a strange name and not a name brand at that, they were striking similar to the Makerbots and they had an average 4+ star review on Amazon.  So I decided on the QIDI brand but now my choice was the QIDI X-One or the QIDI Tech I.  I wanted a larger print area than the X-One offered and didn't give too much thought to dual extrusion at the time.  Another day or two comparing both models and I went for the QIDI Tech I.\nThe printer arrived yesterday packaged very securely.  Unboxing was easy and wow this thing is heavy and solid. A couple of minutes later I had the extruders, the handles and acrylic shields attached however I wrestled with turbo fan housing for an hour (if only the SD card was packaged on top with a note that said WATCH THE VIDEOS ON THIS CARD BEFORE ASSEMBLY) it would have saved me time and frustration.\nAfter assembly, power up, bed leveling and filament loading I was ready to print!!  Wait software! I have to load software on my computer next. The SD card has two software packages Makerbot Makerware and ReplicatorG.  The instructions suggested I load ReplicatorG for dual extrusion printers so I tried that.  After an hour unsuccessfully able to get the python accelerator (whatever that is) to load I gave up and loaded Makerware.  (If anyone has this printer and was able to get ReplicatorG to successfully load on Windows 10 please reply)\n\nNow with Makerware successfully loaded and the printer assembled and calibrated I was ready to go.  Makerware was extremely straight forward and easy to use.  There are even example files in Makerware that you can download even ones for dual extrusion as well.  I started off printing the 22mm calibration block in ABS then moved to a teapot and finally a two color dual extruded Makerbot pendant using the dual extrusion example.  I have to say the prints came out very good and was amazed how easy it is to print.  I then loaded the PLA filament and printed a series of items as well.\nOverall I am very pleased with the purchase so far and even though its only day 2 with the printer I had to write this review because I feel this printer is one of the very best purchases Ive made on Amazon.\nThe QIDI Tech I is very well built and easy to setup and manage.  For a beginner like me it seems to have the versatility of a heated bed allowing printing in many different types of filament and also the dual extruder makes two color prints a snap.  If you're new to 3D printing and want a printer you can grow into I feel the QIDI Tech I is the very best bang for your buck.\nHopefully I re-post here again in a few months with more positive updates.","summary":"Money well spent.

Layne","reviewText":"So far, I've bought a total of six of these Qidi Tech 3D printers.  The other five are still not assembled, but this 3D printer has been sitting on my desk for a few months and it went through about a month of almost constant printing, largely to test the durability.  I did have one issue.  Two of the four X axis motor wires stretched and broke a couple of inches from the motor, failing with intermittent connections inside the cable after a lot of printing.  It didn't take too long to replace the cable and it's been working well ever since.  The printer is easy to service and repair, and the manufacturer is reported to be very accommodating although I've never contacted them.\n\nThe plastic doors are a bit on the flimsy side but they work.  They're needed to prevent air drafts when printing ABS.  The doors are mostly a cosmetic issue.  Ditto for the acrylic top cover.  It should have been vacuum formed from one piece of heated acrylic, but that would have probably required more volume to ship internationally, so the top is assembled by the customer from flat sheets of thin laser cut acrylic.  The acrylic top seems a bit Mickey Mouse.  Also, the cable cutout in the back of the acrylic top is not the correct shape.  I've thought about laser cutting a properly designed replacement.\n\nThe steel frame is VERY solid and this, along with the XY gantry that leaves the build platform only moving in the Z axis and the fully enclosed design all contribute to good print quality.\n\nI do wish the memory card slot wasn't in such an inconvenient place, hidden under the right front of the build platform after it lowers at the end of a 3D print session.  I also wish the power switch was on the front panel.  The 3D printer must be power cycled to change memory cards, and that's a hassle when printing new objects.  I plan on moving the power switch to the front.  It really should have been designed that way, or the memory card should be hot swap capable.\n\nI've done significant hot rodding of this 3D printer.  My goal is short run additive manufacturing, so it was worth my time to optimize the 3D printer design a bit more.  I moved the spools to the sides and made new spool rollers so it's much easier to replace filament reels, I redesigned the filament feeders and replaced the carry handles with combo handles and filament tubing mounts, and I made a quick release magnetically attached glass plate.  I hope to find time to document these modifications, probably on Thingiverse.  I also use 12\" long stainless .010\" thick shims to level the glass print bed instead of the plastic cards that ship with the printer, and I replaced the cheap wing nuts with 3mm knurled stainless nuts for leveling the print bed.\n\nI mostly print ABS onto glass, using Elmer's X-Treme glue stick in the super jumbo 40 gram size, applied as thinly as possible to room temperature glass, then immediately printed with a 110C heated bed and 230C nozzle.","summary":"Solid & reliable 3D printer, with good print quality.

Here is my experience:\n\nI had already found an unboxing video from Qidi, they have a YouTube channel so I was ready to get the printer up and running quickly.  Out of the box, the video matched what I needed to do to set the machine up.  I set the machine up and leveled the print bed.  I was printing with the included filament within an hour.  My prints were great.  They did send me the wrong SD card as far as the files loaded on it.  The SD card they sent me was for their other printer they sell.  I emailed tech support and I had a link to the proper files within 24 hours.  I did notice that out of the box this printer's light dimmed at times and there was a slight clicking noise coming from the printer.  The prints were great so I thought this must be normal?  Understand, this is only my second 3D printer and my other 3D printer makes a lot of noise compared to this one out of the box.\n\nI continued to print with great results.  I fixed the occasional jam.. re-level of the build plate.. nothing out of the ordinary.  The clicking noise however did get louder.  I contacted Qidi tech support and they were fast to reply.  They had me send them videos of the noise and in return the sent me a video to try and see if it eliminated the noise.  The steps did not fix the noise.  They told me they would send me parts and instructions on how to replace the parts.  I believe within a week+ I had the new parts and in the meantime I was still printing without much issue.  The video they sent had some difficult steps to follow however I followed them and was able to replace the parts.  The noise continued and the machine still had dimming lights.  I emailed Qidi tech support and again the sent me parts to try and fix my problem.  At this point in time the printer was having major issues.  It would stop extruding plastic at the same layer height each print attempt and cause a jam that would wrap the filament around the gears inside the extruder.  I tried both nozzles and different filament (even though the filament I had used successfully before still jammed) with no luck.\n\nI received the new parts as of yesterday. Everything in the printer is working great again.  The machine does not make any noise and the lights do not flicker.  After the latest fix I am printing better than when I originally received the machine.  I am including a picture of a small print I was unable to print before.  This print is not cleaned up and straight off the bed.  Also, the hulk I printed with this machine before the parts and repair but the boombox is after.\n\nSo with the time I spent with Qidi tech support and swapping parts with a new printer you may wonder why I don't rate a 1-3 stars instead of 4 (which will change to 5 if this printer continues to run well), their tech support, even through my frustration, continued to help me until the printer was working properly.  I have to say, they stand by their product.  There is a language barrier there, but I had no issues with the back and forth via email and videos we had to use.  Simply put, they took care of me.\n\nI will keep this review updated as I continue to use the printer.\n\nUpdate (5.25.17):  Putting the fixed machine through its paces and it is rock solid as of this writing.  Updating the rating to 5/5.","summary":"Almost perfect.","unixReviewTime":1494460800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1390"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BVzJ7Fi-L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lCqR4z47L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JusF7OHoL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MZdwkP9VL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"4","verified":false,"reviewTime":"12 18, 2016","reviewerID":"A9SWXSVCHJS6L","asin":"B01D8M32LU","reviewerName":"G.C.","reviewText":"My boyfriend got me this printer as a gift and I really like it.  Out of the box it was easy to assemble, although I hate peeling all the plexiglass protective sheets off.  The hood was the hardest part to assemble, you really need a second set of hands to line  up the bolts with the screws.  I've since done several dual extrusion prints and many single extrusion prints (I have run over 1000 meters through this printer in less than 2 months).  Customer support is really good- I'm sure there is a time difference from me in the US to them, but tonight I e-mailed Audrey around 9pm and heard back from her instantly.\n\nI have printed with PLA, PLA+, ABS, and NinjaFlex TPU (not TPE).  It all works perfectly.  The only thing I need to do to get ABS to stick is run a glue stick over the blue sheet.  Anything else sticks fine, sometimes TOO well, which is why I changed out the bed.\n\nThe biggest downside to this printer is the bed, but there's an upgrade you can buy for that.  The stock bed is non-removable and I felt like I was going to break either the bed mount or anything I printed trying to remove prints.  I ordered a Maghold bed from Amazon and it's been a game changer.  You swap out the steel bed and then you have a magnetic steel sheet that you can bend and twist to pop prints off.  I put the blue sheet on top of that bendy sheet and it works flawlessly with PLA and ABS.  I would like to get some quieter fans for the printer and find a way to reduce bed shaking/vibration but I also have no complaints about the print quality as is.","summary":"Wonderful printer","unixReviewTime":1482019200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1391"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71436pb7hZL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"4","verified":true,"reviewTime":"10 13, 2016","reviewerID":"ARCQW1WP5B39M","asin":"B01D8M32LU","reviewerName":"Jason","reviewText":"I have been using this printer for a few months now.

Now this printer is a big step up from the crappy mini 3D printer I bought from a crowd funder a year ago.\n\nFirst, like most have already said, the instructions for setup are not great. But, you know, even though I was worried when I first got it that it might be difficult, I found out quickly that is wasn't. In reality, it was pretty easy to put together. Most of it is already setup, you just have to put the extruders on and the figure out the calibration. Also installing the cooling fan was pretty straight forward. I was a bit confused when I reviewed the instruction for oiling it, and not having any oil. So I did have to go buy some 3-1 oil. Also, you do get a lot of extra parts, but don't panic, they are only extra parts and you didn't miss something when you put it together.\n\nBeyond that, I have had great success. Admitting my own mistake, of buying black ABS instead of black PLA, I had the settings wrong on my first 2 prints, which gummed up the extruder a bit (be patient if this happens, let it cool off, and just pull of the excess dried filament), because the plate heat setting was too low. After raising the heat level, I got a great print even though the printing setting was still on PLA and the filament was ABS. Didn't realize that until this morning.\n\nWhy did I give it 5 stars? Right now, I am very pleased. I hope that does not change.\n\nSo here is also why.\nPrice - $500 cheaper than the FlashForger Creator Pro, but just as good (or maybe better).\nExtra Special Touches - They include a cooling fan, extra parts and a cool little tool kit.\nCustomer Service - Even though it is a Chinese company, they tried hard to provide information and instructions in English. And from the printed greeting sheet, you can tell they want to make sure you are happy with your product. They even include a Skype contact. Never seen that before from a company.\nPrint quality - Very good so far.\nCalibration - Very easy. It's not self calibrating, but not hard to do.\n\nI'm sure I could keep going on, but won't. I am happy with the printer and recommend if your in the market for a good 3D printer, give this one a chance.\n\nUpdate. Added a new picture of some awesome Star Wars items I found on Thingiverse. Sooo cool.\n\nUPDATE: Awesome Customer Service\nRecently, I was having a bit of trouble getting large flat prints to stay flat and hold to the heat platform. I contacted Qidi Customer service by email and received a response within a day. Audrey, the customer service representative, was very helpful and patient to explain what I was doing wrong and offered suggestions to correct the issues. Seems I had my temperature settings wrong and after correcting them, I got good flat prints, but still had to alter the settings some.\n\nNOTE: The blue plate should be flat and level, however, I found a strange offset on the back-right and back-left when leveling. She said it was normal. I also asked how to set the proper level height and her response was: \"The paper should touch the extruder with a little friction.\"\nThis was very helpful as I was never sure of the friction I should have. I also still need to increase the heat about 4c depending on the size of a flat print. The last 3\" print I did, I set extruder at 220c and plate at 48c, and did get a flat print but a bit of edge warp on one corner.\n\nAnyways, I was very happy with the customer service of this company.","summary":"Very very HAPPY Customer","unixReviewTime":1463097600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1394"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J7dlxrBRL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GuDt6eQSL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61LNFDWqgBL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618vDQoZ9BL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FSjPA2g+L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Y6T6YutqL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iPBfbxSPL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"11","verified":true,"reviewTime":"02 1, 2016","reviewerID":"A3O1RM9S0Q7V21","asin":"B01D8M32LU","reviewerName":"Sam Barrese","reviewText":"Great machine for the price.  As with many other reviews, the worst thing about this are the instructions.  They are definitely lacking.  A full assembly video would be really great since it is hard to show some of the details in pictures like the clear top assembly.  I had to ditch the instructions and just look at the parts I had and figure out how they went together.  Fortunately, if you are intuitive and mechanical in nature you should be fine.  Took me a while to figure it out on my own, but I was able to fully assemble my machine and get it running in a few hours.\nI recommend downloading the free MakerBot software.  Much better than the software that came on the SD card.  The software that came on the card was hard to figure out what I was getting in terms of supports and rafts until they printed out (wrong the first two tries).\nNow that I have a month of printing under my belt, I can try to help some people out as I was getting ready to smash something because my prints were coming out terrible at first.  The biggest thing that really changed my prints from terrible fails to very consistent was the cooling fan.  I am printing mostly in PLA and I was tackling a probably advanced print for my second attempt and here is my advice.  The object was a small ball bearing.  Everything is printed in place.  The problem I was having is the second (not used) extruder head was hitting the print and causing serious issues.  I leveled the platform, checked to make sure the second extruder was the same elevation as the main head, but nothing worked and I couldn't figure out why it was happening over and over.  On my 6th attempt, I finally figured it out.  the cooling fan was not coming on so my edges were curling up.  I had figured the program would activate this fan and control it, but apparently not.  In the menu while the printing is starting, you can manually turn on the cooling fan and it was like night and day.  My raft was coming out very spiky and when I turned the fan on, the rest of the print was very smooth.  After that, all i had to do was tune in my temperatures and I can print pretty successfully now.\nLove the machine, I even printed my first dual print this past weekend.  Came out great.

This solves both the corrosion problem and the wires pulling out problem.\n\nThis is a great price on good quality connectors.\nI would recommend this pack to anyone needing to restock\n\nSopoby provided these connectors to GadgetClass for testing and review","summary":"Good Quality Dual Wall/Adhesive Lined Heat Shrink Butt Connectors!","unixReviewTime":1461715200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1402"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81s35ChvtQL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81s35ChvtQL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"01 8, 2017","reviewerID":"A13UAVT45110ZB","asin":"B01DO9ZMQK","reviewerName":"tJones","reviewText":"Worked great.

Each bag also has a sheet showing the type and size of filament, the color, and the print temperature. What I have done after opening each little bag is to put each filament, silica gel and original bag that shows the info into separate Ziploc bags.\n\nThis filament works great; I haven't had any of it break on me. My pen was set on 170 degrees C and it was not easy to get the filament to stick to the bottom. I finally set it to 190 degrees C (the temp it shows on the sheet included with each color), and what a difference; now it sticks much better and is easier to work with. To me it's kind of like drawing or painting.\n\nThere are so many colors in this set (even one fluorescent) and 25 ft. per color is a lot of filament.

My biggest issues with it are the included \"tools\" and the dual USB/Micro USB port.\n\nThe included tools are nice to have, but the way they're designed to be attached is ridiculous... all of them except the 90 mirror. The magnet and the hook both have a little clip bent into the end of the wire, and a little collar slides over the wire to hold it to the head. Unfortunately, this collar is too small to actually apply any useful force through the hook or magnet, too large to hold those tools in place and just cheap in general... If they screwed into the end of the head like the mirror does, this would not be an issue. Unfortunately, as it stands, tape is the best way to hold them on. I might be able to fabricate something more useful with my 3D pen, but that's not something everyone can do.\n\nThe dual USB/Micro USB port is nice in theory, but I think the Micro USB port is too large and not quite in spec. Every time I connect and disconnect it from my phone, I feel like I'm going to break it. The regular USB is fine, but this shouldn't be an issue...\n\nOverall, this is a nice addition to any tool box (hardware, medical, around the house, etc).

First reaction, there are a LOT of parts and screws.  I spent ~2 hours a night over 3 days assembling this, making sure everything was aligned as I went.  The parts list (which is a separate PDF from the manual) doesn't really have descriptions for what each part is, so you kind of have to do visual association on some of the extruded pieces.\n\nBefore it arrived, I went to Harbor Freight and bought a small parts organizer box.  I then spent an hour sorting all of the small bags of screws into this organizer, transferring the labels from the little baggies as I went.  HIGHLY recommend this step, especially if you have a large dog with a duster for a tail (2yr old Husky/Malamute mix here) that constantly brushes up against the table.\n\nThe build overall went very smoothly.  I had also watched all 4 assembly videos from HackAWeek on youtube, although it looks like the manufacture has already made improvements based on his observations (kudos to Hictop for that).  One part I personally recommend, attach the power cord and controller power to the powersupply before mounting the powersupply.  There is plenty of slack, and it is far less awkward.\n\nMy first print was the supplied test.gcode.  I didn't have a computer setup for the printer yet, and only had my tablet to download and transfer files to SD, but it worked.  The first try failed when the extruder got caught on the masking tape covering the bed, likely due to me setting the PLA preheat too high or putting the masking tape aligned front to back as opposed to side to side.  Second two false starts were because I didn't have the filament inserted all the way, so it wasn't feeding.  Fourth attempt started off ok, but then the base ripped off the bed, creating a mess.  A quick review of the part 4 video on youtube and some quick adjustments to the autolevel sensor, and I restarted again.  This time, everything started working properly.  I took a brief video (~10 seconds) when it was at 15%, then went to bed.  The next morning, I found a nice 4 leaf clover shaped shot glass (pla) sitting on the print bed, very well detailed and smooth on top.  The sides feel rough due to the slicing and printing (like the pages in a closed book), but that can be smoothed with various post-printing touch up techniques.\n\nI have now setup a computer station for this setup (Intel NUC with Ubuntu 16.04), and am learning about the slicing process.  I have ~18 inches left of PLA from the sample they provide with the kit, after printing the test.gcode file and two spool adapters from Thingiverse (search for HatchBoxSpindleForAluminumFrameHictopPrusa).  These didn't print with anywhere near the quality of the cloverleaf, but I discovered some default gcode settings that I didn't have when I converted the spindles.  Another learning experience.\n\nPros:\nHaving played with Erector sets as a kid in the late 70s - early 80s, and working with extruded aluminum assembly for the last 15 years, this wasn't a big deal for me (actually found it enjoyable).  Print quality seems ok.  No glitches.\n\nCons:\nManual could be improved.  A lot.  Almost of the images are computer generated, but the components tend to blend, especially when they are the same black color.  For example, the stepper motors don't show the connector, and it is only after mounting them that they show the proper orientation.  I had my X axis fully assembled with the belt tensioned when I discovered the power connector was facing the wrong way.  Easily fixed without having to remove the belt (just loosen the screws and rotate the motor).\nFor belt tensioning, I found a tip that worked very well; tension the belt and ziptie it in place before tightening the stepper motors.  This tightens the belt further by a few mm, which is perfect.\nThe provided version of Cura on the DVD (even though I am a Linux guy and had to get my own copy) is 2 years old.  Get the latest version from Ultimaker (it still supports this printer).\nCalibrating my autolevel seems to be wrong.  I followed along with the included video, and set it to print a new project, but the head decided to engrave the first layer into the table, as opposed to just pushing filament down.  Will recalibrate and try again.  At least the fine groove can be readily covered by tape.\n\nBiggest tips:\nResearch and read all of the tips from other users.  Learn from others.\nI used two old CDs to keep the sample PLA from going everywhere.  Highly recommend this, as the PLA is like a big slinky otherwise.\n\nSo, why only 4 stars?  This printer is not for everyone.  I personally know a lot of people that would have given up after organizing the screws.  And there are still improvements that need to happen (manual).  But, being an open hardware design, and seeing the improvements already included Since the assembly videos were made (it would appear that this has the Prussa I3 MK2 improvements already), I think this is an excellent kit for those that want to tinker and learn about the process.  Some of the parts look like they were printed, while others look more refined and were injection molded or laser cut acrylic, suggesting that as parts are refined, they are moved to improved manufacturing processes (the filament sensor housing which is fairly new is a prime example).\n\nI may add additional images later.

Arnold","reviewText":"I looked at various 3D printers for weeks before settling on the Prusa i3 made by HICTOP. I chose this printer because of the frame being made from extruded aluminum, the heated aluminum bed, the integrated controller, and that it has mostly metal parts. I had my doubts about the quality of a printer built from a kit but those doubts were unfounded. I bought this printer with the auto Z option but wanted to review the same printer under this non auto Z version. This printer kit is made from quality parts and the assembled printer is equal to printers that cost $2000. I have seen some of the expensive printer's output and this printer is as good. I'm extremely pleased with the assembled printer and I am very glad I took a chance on this vendor. In addition to a great printer kit, the vendor has answered two of my questions promptly. One of the questions was a request for the controller firmware. They gave me the source code which even included the Arduino Environment. This company deserves much praise for putting together such a fantastic 3D printer kit. I do have to warn you that this kit takes quite a lot of time to assemble and parts of the process are difficult. It took me 12 careful hours to assemble the kit. If you don't think of yourself as mechanically or electrically inclined, this kit might be frustrating. After 12 hours assembling the kit, I turned it on for the first time. The motors whirred, the display lit up and it was ready to go. The first object I printed came out great which does not usually happen. HICTOP is thoughtful enough to supply a G-Code file all ready to go for this printer. You copy the file to a flash card and print from the card. I have run this printer for no less than 40 hours during the last week. It is tough, it is good looking, and it holds its calibration. Below are some details about the various parts of the printer kit.\n\nFrame - The frame is made from 20mm x 20mm extruded aluminum. This frame is stiff and straight. You can't even compare printers with plastic or wood frames to this industrial like chassis. The extrusions are held together with aluminum brackets that are beefy and hold each corner and the uprights true. It does take a bit of fiddling to get each corner flush so that the frame is square. I also had to work on getting the upright frame in the correct position and locked down by the side panels. The side panels are made of heavy gauge steel and hold the controller on one side and the power supply on the other side. I was expecting cheap screw hardware but was delighted to open a bag of hex cap screws which are all nickel or chrome plated. The hardware is so shiny that I can't tell if it is chrome or nickel. The kit also includes tools to assemble the kit. Almost all screws are cap heads which require various sizes of Metric Allen wrenches. The frame does not include end caps for the extrusion but I was able to print them from files found on Thingiverse. You can see my extrusion end caps in some of the photos. This kit is nearly all metal. The frame, the bed, the motor mounts, and the extruder are metal. The parts that are not metal are mostly thick black 8mm ABS  laser cut plastic. The plastic parts are top quality including the few 3D printed parts.\n\nPlastic Hardware - Almost this whole printer kit is made from metal but there are some plastic parts including a few 3D printed parts. The 3D printed parts are the two X axis end pieces, the extruder feed, and the extruder fan shroud. Thats it. Those parts are nice solid 3D prints with no drooping or distortion. The laser cut parts include the bearing rod mounts (X, Y, and Z axis) and the Y axis pulley mounts. The laser cut parts are of beautiful with smooth edges and very precision. I am happy that there are more laser cut plastic parts than 3D printed parts. The quality is a bit better on laser cut parts.\n\nMetal Hardware - All of the motor mounts except the X axis are made from heavy gauge steel.  The LCD display and filament spool rack are metal as are the side panels and most of the extruder. The extruder is mostly metal but it does have a plastic feed mechanism which is one of the few areas I consider a little on the weak side.  All of the screws and various bits of hardware are all top quality. They in fact are nicer than I expected. Many of the metal pieces which attach to the extrusions use special slot fasteners. They are difficult to use at first but once you get the hang of installing them that are easy to use for attaching corner brackets, side panels, spool holder, and LCD display. All bearing rods were cut to the exact length and are chrome polished smooth and straight. The bearings (6) are all house in aluminum holders with threaded holes are beautifully made. I added a little 3in1 oil while assembling the bearing structures and everything moves silky smooth. Many printer kits use 3D printed bearing holders with tie wraps to mount them. The bearings and their mounts on this printer are far better than almost any other printer.\n\nElectronics  I was doubtful of an all in one controller where the motor drivers were on the board. One bad driver and the whole board is useless. So far so good. The controller is very nice quality. I especially like all of the JST connectors for stepper motors, end switches and temperature sensors. You cant plug them in backwards and each of the connectors is a different size based on function. The controller is actually a standard design called the MKS V1.3 and is made by multiple companies so replacements are available. The motor drivers run cool without a fan and I was able to easily establish communication with my computer using the supplied drivers.\n\nSoftware, CD, and Example Files  Wow! They supplied a CD with everything you need. Cura is the slicer and control software.  They included the driver software. They included assembly documents, Cura setup document, bed leveling instructions, and examples. I found everything I needed. I requested and received the controller firmware. These guys did a great job. There are also videos on YouTube showing much of the same things as the documentation.\n\nDocumentation and Assembly Instructions  The main assembly document is 95 pages long and is very detailed. It depends on CAD drawings to show each step. There is little text but I was able to figure it all out without too much trouble. I did not print the document. I placed it on a laptop and flipped through it from there while completing each step. I actually had a lot fun putting this printer together and would not hesitate to help a friend build one. The documentation was weak in that it was mostly CAD snapshots with almost no text and the wiring section was too brief. The supplied pictorial diagram makes up for the lack of step by step wiring instructions.\n\nTools and Extras  HICTOP supplies a bag of tools needed to assemble the printer and they include all kinds of supplies including masking tape for the heated bed, wire ties, extra screws, and a small amount of filament. You can tell they really want you to be successful building and operating your printer for the first time. Everything you need is in the kit.\n\nPackaging - The printer arrived in a sturdy box with all parts wrapped in plastic and placed in foam pockets. There are two layers with the parts and minimal instructions on the top with a CD with the full instructions and software. I was very glad to see the CD. I was quoted a 4-6 week delivery time but much to my joy, the printer arrived in 4 days!!! Dont count on this happening but its nice to know that they aren't putting kits together after they get an order. I was so happy to open the kit and to see the great quality parts.\nNo product is perfect including this printer. I really like this printer and would do it all again. I did run into a few problems which I will mention.\nThe bearing that provides the idler end to the Y axis belt was too tight between its mounting ears. The solution was to leave the screw loose so as to not bind the Y axis action. I consider this a minor issue which I will fix with a modification to the mount.  All of the sheet metal that connects to the extrusions uses M5x8 metric screws which are just a bit too long. They bottom out in the extrusion. The solution is to add a washer. The manual fails to remind you to switch the power supply to 110V for USA operation. I knew about this issue from reading other reviews so I wasn't stumbled by it. The power supply voltage switch setting has caused multiple people to think their printer was malfunctioning. The wiring section of the manual is a little terse but they do supply a great diagram that is enough to get you through it. My extruder nozzle was a 0.8mm not a 0.4mm. This caused me some print quality problems because I entered 0.4mm based on HICTOP's  instructions for Cura. Once I replaced the nozzle with the correct one, my print quality was great. Thats it. If you read the reviews, you will know about the power supply and about the correct extruder nozzle issue from me.  Last, the USB cable is 6 long and is useless so you will need your own USB cable; not a big deal.\n\nIm printing all kinds of things as is typical of new 3D printer owners. I am amazed at how solid this printer is and that it does a great job on prints that run for hours. I successfully printed the MakerBot articulated robot which is used for testing printers. I couldn't be happier with this printer.\n\nUpdate: January 12, 2016\nI have downgrade this product by one star because there are design flaws which must be addressed for this printer to be reliable and accurate. I have addressed the flaws to my satisfaction but others may be expecting a more turnkey experience. This comment explains how some people are happy with this kit and others bash it. I can't emphasize enough that this kit requires a significant investment in your time and that it requires a lot of tweaking to make it a reliable and accurate printer. If you are willing to invest that time, you can make a $400 kit into a 3D printer that equals assembled ones that cost $1500-2000.

After looking at all the options (fully assembled vs. kit, specs/features, material types supported, price vs. performance, customer support, etc.) I decided on this HICTOP printer. This printer comes as a kit and is similar to the Prusa i3. It was shipped in a well-packaged foam box, which included a CD that contained the necessary software, an instruction guide, hand tools, and assembly video (it also contained several extra fasteners - all metric). The quality of the components appears to be high.\n\nAs others have stated, the assembly of this kit requires a medium level of mechanical and electronic aptitude to put it together, get it aligned/calibrated, make the electrical connections, and route the wire harnesses. Taking my time, altogether it took me approx. 6 hours from opening up the box to making the first test print. The first print was terrible (almost no Z-axis travel), as the Z-axis lead screw pitch was mis-configured for the lead screws shipped in the kit. I sent an email to HICTOP and within minutes I had a response and after determining the problem (lead screw pitch - 1mm/rev) I was sent a link to download the correct firmware. Flashing the firmware was a breeze, and about an hour after my contact with HICTOP I make my first successful print. Thanks, Chris - great customer service!\n\nI've since added a couple of items to make printing easier (I'm primarily using PLA filament) such as adding LEDs to illuminate the hot bed print surface as well as placing a sheet of Kapton tape to the hot bed (when cool, the PLA just pops right off). The included Cura software (which drives the printer) is easy to use, and HICTOP provided typical starting point parameters for printing PLA and ABS. After designing and printing several parts, I can see that it will take some time to understand the many variables that go into successful 3D printing (temperatures, print speeds, layer thickness, etc.) - which would be for any printer - but I look forward to dialing in (OK, playing with) this HICTOP 3D printer in the future. In it's stock form, it already makes prints that exceed my expectations.\n\nFor anyone that wants to get into 3D printing, has some mechanical and electrical skills, and is willing to assemble a printer (how better to learn how it works than to put it together?), this is a solid printer. I suspect that with time and experience I will make some upgrades and modifications to improve this printer further, but even as stock, I highly recommend it. I think you'll learn a lot, have fun, and be able to make some great prints with this printer. I am very pleased with my decision to purchase this printer.","summary":"Great printer for the money!","unixReviewTime":1437177600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1415"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sBjsH95CL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":1,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"12 7, 2017","reviewerID":"A87PLUAE9QTCY","asin":"B01E91K4N8","reviewerName":"Jonathan E Cohen","reviewText":"Very disappointed in the specifications of the belt.

The chassis design and motor configuration make this a durable and solid printer.\n\nBack in the day you either had to shell out a lot of money, or spend a lot of time researching designs and sourcing parts to build your own 3D Printer. Luckily that has changed over the last few years and 3D printing is becoming more and more affordable. GeeeTech/GiantArm are doing a good job positioning themselves as a new leader in the retail 3D printer market. You can see the evolution of their designs and company from the early models to their current offerings which include multi-extruder (multi-color) printers like the Prusa and Rostock printers. I can't wait to get my hands on those! They are constantly improving their products, even adding a part cooling fan to the Me Creator 2 even in the last couple weeks.\n\nAs far as a 3D printer goes, the Me Creator 2 has the best balance between price, features and component quality that I have seen. Many more expensive printers lack some of the features the Me Creator 2 has. The rigid cube chassis allows one to add on enclosure panels, additional lighting an cooling and other bells and whistles. Having the power supply and control board fully enclosed underneath the printer keep it looking clean while protecting all of the vital electronics.\n\nThe front LCD PID control output is very nice. Even just being able to preheat the extruder to change filaments without a computer attached makes this an awesome feature, but adding to that full manual control and standalone printing capability is something to be said for a 3D printer in this price range.\n\nThe default config files they link to in the user manual work pretty good for most situations. Make sure you start with those. The link is on page 44 of the user manual. I ended up doing a lot of tweaking and messing around to get the best possible prints I could on different parts. When it comes to 3D printing, every printer, even every brand or color of filament takes minor adjustments and setting changes. I'm going to do a series of videos on my GadgetClass YouTube channel to cover a lot of the basics. I will post my better Slic3r config files there as well so make sure you check that out if you are having any difficulties with this printer.\n\nMy only complaints about this printer are:\n1: The bottom cooling fan is in the back, right, bottom corner, where the home position is. The little hairs and bits of filament that ooze out can get sucked into the fan\n2: I would like to see 4 screws instead of just 3 for leveling the bed.\nBoth of these are minor and all 3D printers have quirks like this\n\nI have spent a lot of time every day for the last 3 weeks using and testing this printer to give everyone the best review I could. After all of that time (and filament) I can easily recommend this printer. Whether you are just starting out or need another single extruder printer, this is a good solid option for the price point.","summary":"Good Solid and Feature Packed Design for the Price!","unixReviewTime":1476835200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1417"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ofihwEgZL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bSeTOr-cL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710XZnD9wVL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718MU+waI9L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816pbdcfKkL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"6","verified":true,"reviewTime":"07 6, 2017","reviewerID":"AOPYVEXALWQO5","asin":"B01EAFRGT8","reviewerName":"AZbuyer","reviewText":"First off, I REALLY like this printer!\n\nI have a 3D Delta printer that was very hard to set up, and would not give even slightly decent prints without some pretty serious modifications, so I thought I would try this one.\n\nAfter I took care of a couple of minor issues created in shipping (more on that later), the printer just works and performs like I hoped it would.  I\nreceived the printer 8 days ago and it has been running pretty much 24 hours a day since then with no problems that weren't of my own creation.  So far I have printed with two colors of PLA filament, and one color of ABS.\n\nThe first thing I did was level the bed per the instructions (they are not great, but understandable).  the printer is shipped with a test print on the bed that was very nice.  Getting the first print set up using PLA filament was very easy, and I was very pleased at how well it stuck to the supplied blue tape.  There was an initial issue with the X axis printing (see the right test cube in the picture), but I quickly traced it to a loose pully on the X axis stepper motor and tightened the set screws and got the beautiful test cube on the left.\n\nQuick pros:  Quick Cons:\nVery easy to set up  A couple of easily fixed issues from shipping\nMakes beautiful prints  The filament holder is a bit cheesy, and allows the filament to tangle a bit easily\nPrints PLA and ABS with heated bed\n\nI intend to write much more on this review, but thought I would get it started.

But the PLA PRO (PLA+) is a LOT stronger, and more flexible after printing.\n\nTo strength-test it, I ran a print with the PLA PRO+ that I had consistently had trouble with just using plain PLA.  The problem print has a latch that would snap under pressure when the support was removed.  (Six times in a row - very frustrating.)  The PLA PRO filament printed at a slightly higher temperature than the regular PLA, and it was.....creamier.  (Sorry...not a terribly masculine word....but that's what it was.)  It was strong enough that I was able to remove the support without breaking the latch off into my hand for the seventh time, and it flexes enough to allow the latch to close and open easily.  No fear of it cracking again.\n\nThe support was not overly clingy either, which I would have expected.  But it came away cleaner than regular PLA supports. Definitely a pleasant surprise.\n\nI wanted to test it on overhangs as well, so I put it up against another print that had caused trouble for me with overhang curl and heat pitting on a curved bottom surface.  The underside of the egg shaped print usually developed pitting, (even with support), in PLA.\n\nI absolutely didn't believe the results of this test...which was run with NO SUPPORT for the PLA PRO (PLA+) filament, on a smaller version (heat soak effect magnified), just to see what it would do.  I'll put the pictures below, because otherwise, you won't believe it either.  (Keep in mind, the bottom of the white PLA egg had support underneath it, and it still looks like a mountainside.  The black PLA PRO egg showed a smooth surface with ZERO support, and the top of the egg did NOT collapse!  I've NEVER been able to print that egg without center support.  The PLA PRO printed without it.  (Gonna be reprinting all of those as well in the PLA+.)\n\nI tested a couple of Benchies - the PLA PRO handled them just fine without any added support.  There was no warping or curling.  (I do run a MIC6 plate with a PEI coating, so warp is not usually a problem, except on steep overhangs.)\n\nFinally, I did a test on heat resistance, and there was no significant gain in the PRO filament. Both straightened segments slumped in a 250F (120C) oven, at about the same time.\n\nBottom line - this is by far the best PLA I've tested. The only thing I noticed was a few absolutely miniscule zits here and there, because I haven't dialed it in yet.  It's slightly shinier than regular PLA, but the shine can be easily and uniformly knocked back with a damp Magic Eraser.\n\nGive it a try and see if you like it as well. It is so easy to print, you'll never go back to the other stuff.\n\nUpdate:  Just printed a flat box divider that shows the flex on this stuff - the divider is 2.8 mm thick, so it would be pretty stiff (and might break) when bent this much, if it was printed from plain PLA.  The curvature was not imprinted into the divider though - it flattened back out.","summary":"This is What PLA is Supposed to Be","unixReviewTime":1463443200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1419"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81uUH9EvSCL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81U5ILRptSL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"3","verified":true,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2017","reviewerID":"A1UBZ4IBW7F61P","asin":"B01EKEMDA6","reviewerName":"Jessica Arnold","reviewText":"Printed great!

With the addition of black to the other spools I had already purchased, I had almost every color needed to print a project that caused normal PLA to break during assembly and that is the MakerBot Nutcracker (thing 579567 on Thingiverse).  I made a dozen of these a couple years ago for family as Christmas presents.  I had to file down the assembly tabs since with regular PLA, they would snap when assembling.  I'm happy to report that when I built it out of PLA+, I had no tabs break (well, I ended up with two broken ones but that is because I bent the piece when assembling).  I was able to put the whole thing together without having to glue the parts like I did with PLA.  Once part, the mustache, was extremely hard to get right with PLA because of the overhangs.  I would have to do a lot of cleanup work on it.  With PLA+, I was able to use it as is right off the printer!  I also had problems with stringing between parts with PLA.  Not with PLA+.  The pictures are the PLA+ parts on the printer.  I used the same settings as I did for PLA, but upped the bed temperature from 60 to 65 and the hot end from 205 to 220.\n\nNow if they would just offer a Tan color, I could do it in all PLA+.\n\nI'm going to join in here a sing the praise of eSun's new PLA PRO (PLA+).  I took advantage of the sale price ($3.00/spool - better than nothing) and took a gamble buying 7 rolls untested.  I have used eSun PLA and PETG for some time and have never had any real problems with it so figured the risk was worth it.  Also, when you buy 6 at once, you get another 5% off.\n\nSo far I have only printed with the brown and it is coming out perfect.  No build up like I get with PETG after awhile.  I normally print in PLA for most things, but use PETG when I know the object could be subject to some flexing.  In testing the strength, I printed a 2mm thick bar.  If printed in PLA, it would snap after just a few degrees of deflection.  With PETG, I can bend it in half without it breaking.  The PLA+ was in between the two, but closer to PETG.  I was able to bend it to over 90 degrees without it breaking.  At about 135, it did break, but not snapped in two like PLA.\n\nThis is going to be my new replacement filament as I use up my PLA stock.","summary":"The better PLA","unixReviewTime":1464134400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1427"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CYtUGXNDL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XJMmDo9mL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sBc6eG84L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61txmPq5FFL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61o1wfAlP6L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DXAFPPbyL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"38","verified":true,"reviewTime":"08 30, 2016","reviewerID":"AZZGB87A5N9QI","asin":"B01EKEMUIG","reviewerName":"Kim in Texas","reviewText":"I love this filament.

No, really.  As a do-it-yourself Chinese import, my expectations were low.  Acrylic frame, generic Asian parts, and advertisement that seems too good to be trusted.  This is my second 3D printer, with my first being an M3D which needed warranty replacement after just a week.  The first thing that impressed me was certainly not the assembly manuals and videos, but the well-organized packaging, with every nut and bolt clearly labeled.  The second thing that impressed me was the fact that all nuts/bolts/washers are polished and smooth.  And, while technically it does have every tool you need for assembly, I preferred my higher quality tools for this work.  Together with my former skills with building and racing RC trucks, I felt confident in my skills for assembling this kit.\n\nEverything went together as expected.  The instructions left some room for interpretation but the videos included with the DVD were helpful.  I suggest you watch some YouTube videos as well.  And, speaking from my RC experience again, make sure you use threadlocker on ALL parts that fasten metal-to-metal.  This entire machine vibrates as a matter of regular function, so this is vital.  After assembly, a few test prints, and lots of tweaking, I can say I am SO happy with this product that I would recommend this to anyone looking for a budget printer and is not afraid to work your way to perfection.  Keep in mind that this is NOT a plug-n-play 3D printer and real work needs to be done to get great prints.  But, build quality and print quality are far better than I ever expected.

This actually was my 3rd printer.  It was the first printer I bought that was a complete waste of money from the start.  First of all despite following both the paper guide and the video on wiring the power supply, the first time I plugged it in the room filled with smoke and the power prongs partially melted (see photo).  Luckily my circuit breaker tripped or an electrical fire would have been likely.  I was able to repair this, but really I should have stopped here.  The problem was that both the video and the wiring guide in the instructions showed a slightly different power supply than the one I was sent  - the difference is in the faint metal engravings, otherwise it was identical, but by simply following the instructions I was given I nearly caused a fire as I wasn't expecting a different power supply than the one on the item list.  I should have checked it a bit closer, but both the video and the assembly instructions said to do it this way, so I did.  If they are sending out different power supplies now then those directions need to be updated ASAP.  Second, the screws I was sent for the fan guard > fan > heat sink > extruder (connecting to each other in that order) were too long, but had they been the right size, it wouldn't have mattered as the heat sink didn't have screw holes anyway.  I e-mailed Hictop about this and verbatim their response was \"try to do it again and do it slower.\"  Oookay, thanks for nothing.  I go to Lowe's and get some proper screws and manage to assemble it.  I turn it on and my computer doesn't recognize it (Window's 10).  I download drivers, install a different version of Cura, try a different USB cable, nothing.  I've printed with an SD card before, I'll try it again just to get this calibrated.  Well, you have to unscrew the LCD screen to insert the SD card, since the mounts for the printer filament block it.  Lastly, I attempted to calibrate my printer and was met with a \"Heating fail\" message on the LCD screen.  Thank goodness for Amazon, because Hictop customer service won't back up their garbage-grade products.\n\nEdit:  After posting this I received an e-mail from the seller.  They apologized for their first e-mail and then told me to attach all those parts by the \"upper holes.\"  They only have lower holes.  Next step was to \"install the fan with the label facing inside\" followed by a screenshot of their instructions where it literally says \"the sticker on the fan facing out.\"  I know English is not their first language, but this is lazy at best and dangerous at worse.","summary":"Garbage, nearly started a small fire, doesn't work properly","unixReviewTime":1474243200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1435"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l2tfpTc6L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81voqvhrh0L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dTcidzZNL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"47","verified":true,"reviewTime":"07 29, 2016","reviewerID":"A2ASKZL7QAL66M","asin":"B01ERDWSFU","reviewerName":"Steven H.","reviewText":"<div id=\"video-block-R1WG5FRWFIUR5\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1VjLlhTXzS.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ceB5J6hgS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">&nbsp;I'll start off by saying this is my second 3D printer kit.  I think that helped in making this one easier to put together and setup because I already had an idea of what needed to be done.  With that said though, my first 3D printer never really worked right.  I got it 5 or 6 years ago, it was a low quality kit (it used printed plastic as \"bearings\"!), and I never really got a good print from it after fiddling with it for a long time.  It sat in storage for a lot of those years until about a 4 months ago when I decided to pull it out and start fiddling again ultimately leading to me throwing in the towel with it and buying this one.\n\nThe difference is quite amazing.  I've gone from only having a single semi successful print in 5 to 6 years of ownership on the old printer, to already printing 4 things successfully in a few days of ownership with this new one.  The quality of the parts is very nice.  The acrylic looks great, but be sure not to overtighten the screws or you could crack it.  I may upgrade the acrylic to aluminum at some point (I am buliding a CNC that will be capable of cutting aluminum as well hehe), but it's sturdy as is.  The instructions where mostly accurate, there were a few spots that were off a little but nothing to hard to figure out.  Overall it probably took me about 6 hours of total time working on it to get it assembled and then another 30 minutes to calibrate everything and get my first print.\n\nA few issues to note:\n-The plug that came with the unit is 110v but EU standard coloring.  It has no ground and no power switch which I was not crazy about.  So I went to lowes and got a grounded 3 plug extension cord, cut off the outlet end to wire it up to the printer power supply, and added a 110v 20amp switch as well to easily cut the power without having to unplug it every time.\n-There is a design flaw on this model, as other reviews have stated the filament holder support blocks access to the SD card slot on the back of the LCD.  The company has a modified part to correct this and they sent me the STL file for it to make my own if I want.  You can also get around this if you use a micro sd card and sd card adapter.  There is enough room to remove the micro sd card from the adapter.\n-The guide rail holes in the top pieces are slightly to small.  I had to use a drill to open them up a little until the rods would fit through.  Careful doing this though, do a little at a time, you don't want wobble in these rails.\n-The heated bed warps a little when heated, it's thin aluminum, that is what happens.  Smaller prints in one area work fine as is, but anything larger you'll probably want to use a sheet of glass over the top of it.\n-I do have a problem with filament leaking out the top of the heating block.  I've tried tightening it but haven't been able to get it to stop, although I'm wondering if it's partially due to the filament.  It didn't seem to happen for some white filament I have, but did for the little bit of orange that came with the printer.  HICTOP has already said they are sending me a new extruder tip, filament tube, and heating block to try and resolve it as well.\n-The wires at  the control board are a mess!!  I'm going to be printing some kind of enclosure to house them soon lol.\n\nAll of these issues are overall fairly minor.  That is why I only deducted one star for them.\n\nI also want to comment on the support.  I contacted them over a few issues, like a bad print on the turbine fan shroud, and a gouge mark on the heated bed.  After sending them a picture of it, they have sent me replacements.  I haven't actually gotten them in yet, but they are on the way.  The were really responsive with other questions I had and a great help.  Also, even though I believe they are based in China, their english is pretty good.  So I'm very happy with the level of support I have received thus far from HICTOP.\n\nAll in all if you are looking for a lower cost 3D printer that works well, I'd highly recommend this one.  I will update my review if anything changes, but with about 8 hours of printing on it so far everything is going well.","summary":"Great 3D Printer for the price","unixReviewTime":1469750400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1436"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LyslvTFNL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KVCvhUEjL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"05 13, 2018","reviewerID":"A1EEGQFGTUZLBG","asin":"B01ESTJUL8","reviewerName":"Chris","reviewText":"Overall the quality is very good.\nSo far no clogs, and heats good after playing with the position of the cartridge in the heat block.\n\nUPDATED TO 4 STARS\nUPDATE REASON: Extruder began to clog consistantly after this review.

Lionel","reviewText":"Pros:\n+ No fuss, excellent print quality\n+ Simple to use\n+ Very good build volume\nCons:\n- Poor \"getting started\" instructions\n- Proprietary filament spools\n- Software lacks features\n\nI've been into 3D printing since 2012, first with the Printrbot (Kickstarter original) and then the Deltaprintr (also Kickstarter). Over the years I have been thrilled to see the prices of 3D printers come down and the ease-of-use get better with each generation. Nowadays there are some very usable printers for under $300, including the XYZprinting DaVinci MiniMaker.\n\nThe DaVinci Mini looks like a Fisher-Price toy with its bright colors and plastic shell. But inside is a metal-construction printer that is surprisingly capable, once you get it going. Unfortunately, the included setup instructions are lacking. You get a poorly-printed \"Quick Guide\" which has most of what you need, but the size and quality of the pictures makes it hard to know if you're doing things right. If you go to the XYZprinting web site, you can download a PDF User Guide which has a much clearer version of the setup instructions plus details on how to use the software.\n\nAh, the software. The Quick Guide says only to \"go to the XYZprinting official web site\" - which you can probably deduce - but it doesn't say what to do there. It turns out that you have to register for an account in order to download anything. When you do so, don't use special characters in your password - it will accept them but you'll be unable to log in. You might be misled by another sheet included that describes additional software you can download.\n\nOnce you have removed the four plastic clips that secure the mechanism in place, as well as the numerous strips of tape, you should install the software before connecting and powering on the printer. Attach the power supply and connect the USB cable, then flip the power switch on the back to turn it on. The drivers will load, and then you're ready to run the XYZware software, which will require you to log in.\n\nYou're now left on your own. If you click on the button to print a sample file, you'll get an error. First you have to tell the software which model of printer you have - this is done in the settings menu (gears icon). Assuming you've loaded the filament and attached the printbed sheet (basically a big piece of masking tape), you can now print the sample from the Settings > Printer page. The software will import a standard .stl file - when you want to print it will first save to a proprietary .3w file and you can then commence printing. Note that you can disconnect the USB cable once the software has sent the data to the printer, but of course you can't monitor its progress if you do.\n\nMuch is made of the auto-leveling function but I didn't see it do much with that. The User Guide shows illustrations of a panel in XYZware where you can see status of the printer and make several adjustments, but it doesn't tell you that this panel isn't visible until you click on the unlabeled button in the lower right of the window!\n\nThe printer is of the \"Bowden\" style, where filament is pushed through a flexible PTFE tube to the hotend. In this printer, the hotend itself moves in the X and Z directions, and the Y direction is handled by moving the printbed. It always prints at 203 degrees Celsius - there is no control over this. When you start a print, it first extrudes some filament at the right edge of the printbed to \"prime\" the hotend. I found the print quality to be excellent and the firmware is smart enough to slow down if the total layer time is short, reducing problems that might be caused by a lack of part cooling. (The hotend itself has a fan.) The design of the hotend is such that you can't really see what it is doing until a lot of layers have been laid down. I've attached photos of the \"3DBenchy\" demonstration print I made on the DaVinci Mini - it came out very well, as good as my Deltaprintr. Because the room where I have the printer is cool, I had to follow the guide's advice to coat the printbed tape with glue, or else the prints would warp. I brushed on a thin mixture of white glue (Elmer's Glue-All or similar) and water, then let it dry. Others just rub on glue sticks. If you run out of the tape squares, you can use ScotchBlue painter's tape, or possibly&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/BuildTak/dp/B00MN5X304/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BuildTak</a>&nbsp;squares (I like these).\n\n100 meters of filament (a golden-yellow) are supplied. The filament itself is nothing special but the spools have a circuit card inside that identifies the filament to the printer and tracks consumption. When it says you're out of filament, whether or not you are, you have to replace the spool. You can buy the filament at Amazon - make sure you get the spools for the Mini series - but it goes on sale each Tuesday at the XYZprinting web site so you may want to take a look there as well.\n\nThe XYZmaker software contains the \"slicer\" function that converts the generic shape information (.stl file) to the printer commands (.3w file). It has some of the options that other slicers do, but not a lot. For example, you can ask for \"support\", which is used when parts of the print would be hanging in midair - but you can't control what this looks like, or whether support is generated between the buildplate and part or anywhere there are overhangs. You can ask for a brim or a raft, used to enhance adhesion, but can't control the size or makeup of these. I printed an item that required a raft, but the raft couldn't be peeled off the print at all, unlike printing the same part using Cura software and my Deltaprintr.\n\nI was impressed by the variety of accessories provided: a print removal tool, two types of cleaning wire (for cleaning the filament path), a brush to clean the extruder gears, several sheets of the printbed tape and a metal block used for calibration should you need it. The printer has a built-in calibration mechanism which is triggered by an option in the printer status display. There is also a clear plastic shield box you can affix to the front to keep prying fingers away - I didn't use that.\n\nAlthough the XYZprinting DaVinci Mini probably won't satisfy advanced users, it is an excellent \"starter printer\" for seeing how you like the hobby. Once you get it set up, printing is a straightforward, no-fuss affair and it's easy to get consistently good prints. I wish it didn't take the \"inkjet cartridge\" approach that binds you to buying their filament, but at least you should be assured of good results that way.","summary":"Great starter printer, but proprietary filament requirement annoying","unixReviewTime":1482537600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1442"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pRoXEU0YL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710vvInfaSL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61N3Ns6mxjL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61c++2AiSHL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":1,"vote":"5","verified":false,"reviewTime":"05 30, 2017","reviewerID":"AX1D247AREH22","asin":"B01EY6OQXC","reviewerName":"AlphaTrio","reviewText":"Don't buy this printer if you plan to use 3rd party filament.

There are many times when either the wire is too short, or time is too short to to a proper soldered splice.\n\nThese quick taps are better than the standard style in that the spliced on wire connection is a spade style that can be removed without exposing the wire. The standard style requires the spliced in wire sheath to be pierced just like the primary wire, leaving another point of weak connection or failure. These only need to penetrate the wire insulation on the primary wire.\n\nIf you price these at the local auto parts store, you are generally paying about $5 for a pack or 3 or 4. In this pack you get a complete assortment in 3 different wire sizes to make sure you have plenty of splices for any job for quite a while.\n\nThe red maroon color in this kit is the same as normal red ones which are for small wire, Blue for Medium, and Yellow for Larger wire.\n\nInstallation is easy, just lay the quick splice over the wire then, using a pair of pliers, compress the connector closed. As long as you use the proper color/size, you should end up with a good solid connection. Make sure the connector snaps closed. Then crimp the male spade connector onto the wire to be spliced in and push it into the connector.\n\nIf you have any issues, it is possible the wire insulation did not get fully pierced on one or both sides by the tap. Simply unsnap it and look if you can see wire on both sides. If not you may want to try the next size down or try the crimp again.\n\nI have reviewed other wire connectors from Sopoby and have been quite impressed with the quality and value.

I need a wet/dry vacuum cleaner to use in combination with my power sprayer to clean some grout lines inside my house. In case you are not familiar with the century old Porter-Cable company name, it became a subsidiary of Stanley Black & Decker in 2004  via a series of acquisitions and mergers.\n\nThis Porter Cable wet/dry vacuum cleaner has several thoughtful convenience features such as tool storage on the four roll around protrusions. That way they don't get misplaced so easily. It is easy to take the upper vacuum assembly off the bucket to access the trash and filters  just press two side latches slightly outward and lift the top off with the convenient wide handle.  And do the opposite to latch it back. It has a 6 foot hose thats nearly 2 inches in diameter to suck in larger pieces of debris. There are two extensions and two accessory pieces included, but no crevice tool. I've located an inexpensive one that looks like it will fit. I'll order it and post it if it fits. You can move the hose to an exhaust port on the upper assembly if you want to use it as a blower.\n\nThere are three filters all total: Disposable paper vacuum bag (Part Number 19-3100N) and a pleated central filter to use during dry vacuuming.  A foam filter (Part Number 19-1600) is to be used during wet vacuuming.  My early evaluation sample was missing a foam filter.  I sent an email request Sunday night and on Wednesday afternoon I received the foam filter and a paper filter in my mailbox  shipped from Aurora, Illinois to Houston. They sent the tracking number to me Monday afternoon.  Now thats what I call great customer service.\n\nThe advertisement says it has a 4 peak horsepower motor  but thats marketing buzz wording. They all do this. The more truthful number is 8 Amps at 120 Volts or about 960 Watts which equals 1.3 Horsepower on average.  To be certain, my Kill A Watt meter measured exactly 960 Watts. If it ran 4 HP continuously, it would trip your circuit breakers. (1 HP = 745.7 Watts). This vacuum cleaner is not as noisy as my wife thought it would be.  It is so very important to protect your hearing with high quality safety hearing protectors. Once you lose your hearing, its gone forever  cannot ever get it back.  I am living proof.  Thats why I asked my wife's opinion about the noise.\n\nI think this Porter Cable wet/dry vacuum is about the best offering on Amazon in this price range.  I found a Craftsman version that is very similar, but I absolutely do not like the wire clamps they used to hold the top onto the lower bucket  very inconvenient. The Porter Cable version is clearly better and much easier to use in my opinion and it even looks a lot better.  I attached 7 photos, but only two seem to be showing up. I'm reposting it now - maybe I exceeded the limit.\n\nDisclaimer:  I have not used this wet/dry vacuum cleaner extensively, but it appears very well built in my opinion. I only use power tools periodically when I have a new project around the house. I have accumulated a lot of tools over the years, but this is my one and only wet/dry vacuum cleaner.  I think it will be quite durable and certainly last a very long time.","summary":"Great Value - Good Quality - Superb Customer Service","unixReviewTime":1475625600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1454"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81dIUXtz3WL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jHOSl7UvL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"02 6, 2018","reviewerID":"AQWIXWMMY5SSY","asin":"B01FI6IKG6","reviewerName":"chloe","reviewText":"i use those wire connector to connect the wires in or outside fish tank. it works so good.

The first printer broke about 36 days after we got it. The SD card slot stopped reading and even though there's a plug to plug it into the computer to print directly from the computer - it doesn't work. You NEED the SD card slot to work.\n\nSo, Amazon begrudgingly made a very super special exception and let me exchange it. Aside from the warming plate not getting even a little bit warm, and models not sticking, sliding all over, it worked well enough. This one lasted about 2 months before it wouldn't even turn on anymore. All of a sudden the power switch stopped working. So rather than go through Amazon because they made it such a hassle to get help the first time I talked to monoprice directly. I had to ship it back to them, have them repair it, send it back. The whole process took about a month.\n\nI got it back today. They said the wiring in the warming plate was faulty and they replaced it. Now I'm trying to print and everything I print feels like it's glued down. I can't get anything off of the plate. Which wouldn't be SO bad if it was printing correctly. But it's not. It starts to print normally then shifts every model over about an inch. So, every single thing I print is completely useless.\n\nTalking to amazon customer service now. They're blaming me. Saying this is the second time there has been an issue. and want to give me a refund on the sale price. Refusing to exchange it for a working one. Nice. So now I'm out a printer and I spent a bunch of money on all this filament.\n\nThis printer is garbage and so is Amazon's customer service. The last 3 times I spoke with (on chat or email, phone has been fine) them they've been rude, unhelpful, and accusatory. I have no idea what happened to their customer service but it's terrible. I may stick around for smaller things but any big purchases like this are going to have to start being made elsewhere. There's no guarantee of anything working and if it doesn't they tell you it's your fault. Ridiculous. The pictures speak for themselves. You're right Amazon. Clearly this is MY fault...

So what does $200 get you for an entry level 3D printer?  Well you can order a kit from Amazon or China and build it and learn about 3D printing or you can wait for this little gem to go on sale and buy it!  You should do your research prior to purchasing any 3D printer and the Monoprice Select Mini is no exception.  These are actually pretty complex pieces of engineering despite their inexpensive price tag.  They can also burn, pinch, cut and electrocute you!  They are not toys!  Now that the disclaimers are out of the way why 5 stars.  At $220 regular price they are on the cheaper side so they are a great value for what they can do.  I've printed PLA, ABS (not recommended indoors!), PET-G and TPU.  The Facebook Group is friendly and the online group can help the newest most uneducated person to 3D printing get up and running without making you feel embarrassed for asking the question.  Basically your not only buying the printer you get an army of like minded users that'll help you along.  My printer came with a warped print bed.  I was a bit upset.  Looked online and saw it was common.  Cheap aluminum bed (cost savings).  However, most people switch to glass beds and have detailed instructions on doing it.  Costs about $3.  The bed wires fray then break.  Once again it's a known issue.  Detailed instructions for several ways to fix it.  It can cost you anywhere from the cost of your PLA to print the parts to rewire the whole bed.  The built in WiFi doesn't play well with my mesh system I have installed.  Who cares?  Octoprint is the way to go!  Here comes the monster!  I guess the point of this review is in my case if it wasn't DOA (Dead On Arrival) and doing my due diligence by researching various printers and watching videos and asking questions in the community about this printer I knew what to expect and was ready.  When I opened the very nicely packaged printer and set it up it worked as it should.  Follow the videos Monoprice has on YouTube and they'll walk you through the process.  Search Monoprice Select Mini on YouTube and you'll find many videos that'll educate you about the printer.  Overall I like mine and the endless creative possibilities it has opened up.  Other than the warped bed I haven't had any thing \"break\".  Granted I preempted many of the known failures by just replacing or modifying them right away.  There are also many who don't do anything to their printers and they work just fine.

For the money I think it is a good 3D printer but it has its flaws, especially in customer services.\n\nHeat Bed Problem  See picture(and terrible customer service)\nThe head bed helps your printer stick to the print bed, without it your print could pop off or it would warp up.  I notice after having my printer for 2 weeks the prints started warping that's when I noticed the bed wasn't heating.  There are 4 wires coming out of the printer to the build plate 2 for heating 2 for temperature reading.  One of the wires got snagged because the bed moves in and out and the wires feed through a grommet.\n\n I contacted mono price, I emailed them, they never called me.  I tried to use the chat thing and they canceled the chat session, I have the email to prove it.  I didn't want to fix it myself as I was afraid of voiding my warranty.  In the end I had to rewire it, because after I fixed the red wire the black wire snapped.  I ended up by passing the feed, adding wire on the outside of the unit, haven't had a problem sense.\n\nPros\nIts Cheap\nDoes a good job\nEasy to set up\n\nCons\nIts cheap\nTerrible customer service (or lack of customer service)\nHeat bed is a terrible design\nSD card reader only works on FAT, no SDHC cards useable\nVery little documentation\nDoesnt play nice with USB printing\nLeveling the print bed is a PITA (but once leveled you're good)\n\nBottom Line\nIf you're thinking about getting into 3D printing and handy with a soldering iron and you don't want to spend much this is the printer for you.  If you have the money though I recommend buying something better.  I plan on using mine for a year but then I will probably sell it and use the cash to buy a bigger and better unit, something not Monoprice, which makes me sad because I am a huge fan of Monoprice and buy lots of things from them, but I never needed tech support in the past.\n\nTips for New Users\nSD Card  the SD card reader is small, its fine but if you want a second one with more storage get a 2g card and format it to FAT.  I wasted too much time to find out that SDHC cards don't work, as there is 0 documentation telling you about the card reader.\nPrint Bed  The print bed will wear out over time and tear, you have lots of options to replace it, you could use painters tape, or buy a replacement bed or use glass.  A 5x7 picture frame at the dollar store works, clamp it down with binders clip.  On the glass you can use hairspray for a light hold or Elmers Glue Sticks, the glue sticks are made from PLA so PLA prints will hold strong on them.\nRemoving Prints  Prints are hard to pop off if you have a good stick, the plastic print tool it comes with won't get under most prints.  What I do is I get it started with a razor scraper blade and then use the plastic tool the remove the rest, just be careful to keep a low angle as to not cut into the print bed.  If you move to a glass then is less of an issue, and FYI yes the glass will transfer the heat.\n\nWhat to print?  If you don't know how to draw in 3D you can download STL sites from many different sites, you will not run out of things to print, and some prints that are 2 big for your print bed you can scale down.\n\nHow do you print?  - You get an STL file then then you open it with a slicer program, this printer comes with Cura but there are other ones out there. In the slicer you set up how you want it to print, you can print fine layers for a better looking print or a thick layers for a lower resolution stronger print.  You can say what temperature to print and even how much material you want to print between the shell.  10-20% will be fine for most things.  The slicer program will generate a gcode file, you copy the file onto your SDcard (or you can print straight to your printer with a USB cable (but pray it doesnt fail)) then in the printer you pick the gcode file and tell it to print.\n\nHope this helps!","summary":"Good for a started printer but...","unixReviewTime":1516838400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1466"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uA0eBeOBL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MvzzbF56L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-ty85csNL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711Y7L8ps1L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"12 31, 2017","reviewerID":"A1EEGQFGTUZLBG","asin":"B01FL49VZE","style":{"Color:":" White"},"reviewerName":"Chris","reviewText":"I got this as a gift for Christmas.

Level the bed, download some models, throw them in Cura, hit print and wait. Mine was ready to go right out the box, bed was perfectly leveled and my first print was great. After some tinkering in Cura getting the settings dialed in prints have been spectacular. The settings monoprice recommends are good for starting out with basic prints, but with more detailed you will want to go online and find other select owners and see what they recommend. Biggest hurdle is orientation of the model in Cura and the proper support settings.\nThis printer since Christmas Eve has been running almost non-stop printing models I plan on painting and stupid useless stuff just cause I think it was neat.

This is a great beginners printer, IF the beginner has a bit of foreknowledge (i.e. familiar with slicer concepts and tools, understands the basic properties of PLA/ABS/PETG/etc) and manages their expectations (it ain't like a desktop laser printer).\n\nBed calibration is crucial but very easy with a sheet of printer paper.  What I did was to screw the front left (0,0,0) corner down until I was sure the hotend would clear when homed, then homed the axes.  Put paper on the bed and raise that corner until you can just barely feel resistance as the extruder tip slides across (manually slide the extruder left/right).  Then do the diametrically opposed corner, then the others.  Lather, rinse, repeat until satisfied.  The nozzle should feel about the same anywhere on the bed.\n\nWhen printing,  I always use a thin raft, as it allows me the opportunity to fine-tune the bed leveling and temps based on how the first layer is put down.  Also I start the print at 0.30625 above the raft - sticks nice for printing, and releases easy when done.\n\nSo far I have only printed PLA: the translucent white sample, some 'silver/gray', Clear red & green, Copper Fill, and Magnetic Iron without issue. All of my prints (except the red-headed lucky cat) have been at 0.04375mm layer height (yeah, slooow -the Viking took just under 7hr)\n\nThe default temp (200) worked well enough for the sample filament and demo cat, but I adjusted the temp to 210 when I ran out and switched filament to the red to finish the print.\n\nI had to turn the temp up 225 for the magnetic iron on the first few layers, then back to 220 for the remainder of the print.\n\nThe buildtak-like surface has been great, and holds onto prints like the dickens (especially with thin raft), so use caution when removing your prints to avoid tearing of bubbling.\n\nI printed a filament feed guide from thingiverse to assist with TPU, which I haven't tested with yet on this printer.","summary":"Loving this little gem!","unixReviewTime":1512691200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1468"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lYl266i0L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PXmEYR+bL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81dnZvx1u0L._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"12 2, 2017","reviewerID":"A3RRAIE5VGNS0S","asin":"B01FL49VZE","style":{"Color:":" White"},"reviewerName":"Matt","reviewText":"I had this unit for a couple weeks and got some great prints, especially for something around $200. I'd still recommend this printer to people, and I have friends who purchased one based on my suggestion and are happy with it.\n\nHowever, I'm returning my unit because the rear fan started making some noise. It comes and goes, but I'd rather return to Amazon while I'm still within my allowed return window.\n\nWith that said, I'll be purchasing a CR-10 mini instead. For the beginner, this printer is great, but I found that I quickly became engulfed in the hobby. That's why I'm going to take what would be an otherwise frustrating situation of a noisy fan, and turn it into an opportunity to get something a little more intermediate.\n\nThis printer isn't perfectly, but here's my quick list of pros and cons:\n\nPros\n - Small form factor, requiires very little desk space\n- Quality prints\n- Pre-assembled, fast setup\n- Fairly strong community for support\n\nCons\n- USB connectivity is flaky (You have to disconnect/reconnect upon intial connection)\n- SD card support is limited.

You need a <2GB standard SD card, I believe.\n- Mods required to print flexible TPU (very easy to fix)\n- Bed doesn't stay hot enough for large ABS prints","summary":"A good printer for beginners, with a few drawbacks","unixReviewTime":1512172800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1469"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aCRfrR-bL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61bsZRDz6EL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"10 3, 2017","reviewerID":"A3UMHUA8S3UGIL","asin":"B01FL49VZE","style":{"Color:":" Black"},"reviewerName":"David","reviewText":"This is my second 3d Printer  i ordered the CR-10  the first time,  this one has a lot smaller build plate, but it's rock solid  No error no mess ups  Hit Print and it makes it, Very nice just as quick and Looks awesome on your desk =)  Thanks","summary":"Very nice just as quick and Looks awesome on your desk ...","unixReviewTime":1506988800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1470"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71c9A6xx0WL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ytw6dnmEL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DQnHEeG6L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71G4HG9KngL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gMFZRvTQL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71riGoLPJOL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"09 17, 2017","reviewerID":"A1ZITK3JUABB3A","asin":"B01FL49VZE","style":{"Color:":" Black"},"reviewerName":"Matthew E.","reviewText":"<div id=\"video-block-R1POKZF0LVAB4P\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1gpcSMeHIS.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91qKMrQl4LS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">&nbsp;So far this printer is awesome!

The printers in this lab get almost non-stop usage for 8 - 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. You can get excellent prints from this machine, but it will require a lot of maintenance.\n\nPros:\n* Affordable\n* Consistently good prints\n* Small - this would fit on a desk next to you while you work\n* Offers standalone operation\n* Open-source printer allows you to use 3rd party materials, etc.\n\nCons:\n* Major design flaw: Build plate wiring will break over time. *see below\n* Bowden feeding system: The feeding system is poorly implemented. *see below\n* Inconvenient SD port placement: You may actually end up dropping your SD card in the machine. *see below\n\nBuild Plate Wiring:\nThe wires that lead to the heated build plate and thermal sensor are tightly banded to the printer frame in such a way that the wires are forced to bend sharply as the build plate moves back and forth. This will cause these wires to break internally over time. When this happens you will have to make a choice to either have it repaired and wait for the same thing to happen again, or alter the way the wires are run so they are no longer stressed. We've seen this earlier rather than later just due to the sheer volume of printing we do with this device.\nTO BE CLEAR: This is not a matter of *if* this will happen, it is a matter of *when* it will happen.\nSymptoms:\n* You try to print something and it never starts printing (along with one of the two following symptoms)\n* The build plate temperature is 0 degrees (this means the wires to the sensor have broken)\n* The build plate does not heat up and sits at around room temperature (this means the wires to the heater have broken)\n\nBowden feeding system:\nNOTE: I am not saying all bowden feeding systems are bad - this one is just poorly implemented.\nWith this type of 3D printer (FDM/FFF) you will usually see one of two types of feeding systems: bowden or direct. There are pros and cons to each of these systems but generally when someone prefers a bowden system it is because the print head is much lighter when the feeding mechanism are not attached directly to the print head.\nThis particular system (as you can even see in the product picture) very sharply bends the feeding tube that the filament is pushed through. You will experience the following issues with this implementation:\n* Higher resistance on the feeding system during some parts of your prints than others\n* Eventual need to replace the bushings holding the feeding tube in place\n* Eventual need to replace the bowden tubing (when it starts becoming more creased at these sharp bend points)\n* Seemingly random jams.\n* Feeder teeth will grind more plastic as it pushes meaning it will need frequent cleanings to avoid degraded performance over time.\n\nInconvenient SD port placement:\nHoly crap! This could have been done way better. There is a little, tiny micro-SD port on this side that you will need to use if you want your printer to operate in standalone mode (without relying on a computer attached to it). The hole cut on the panel exposing this port is 2 times bigger than it needs to be and the actual port is recessed into the body of the printer. This means you may actually miss the port all-together and drop the SD card into the printer. If this happens you have to unscrew the side panel of the printer in order to remove it and recover the memory card.\n\nIf you are new to 3D printing you will likely have a frustrating experience later on rather than right away.\nIf you are an experienced maker / hobbiest then this is actually a really good printer. You just have to keep it running with a little extra love and attention.","summary":"Good prints, but high maintenance.","unixReviewTime":1502323200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1472"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VzQS4oLVL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Nar6QQteL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FB6oUN7gL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dVZNWEllL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":3,"vote":"4","verified":true,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2017","reviewerID":"A1W6E5GBLB9G3I","asin":"B01FL49VZE","style":{"Color:":" White"},"reviewerName":"Tim","reviewText":"This is a phenomenal printer for the price.

I use blue painters tape in three strips to completely cover the bed. i do have a 1mm gap between each strip of tape which doesn't affect the print one bit, but over lapping the tape will.\ni use normal school glue like Elmer's white glue one the bed for bed adhesion which stick on extremely well. do not use hair spray, it leaves a residue and you have to change the tape more often and the chemicals can eat the grease off of the axis rods. when the bed is one degree from the temperature you want then i use the included yellow scraper to spread the glue, if you do it too early it dries up and cools the bed down taking even longer to heat up.\nremember half the battle is adjusting the slicer settings, it can greatly affect the print quallity, most of the time the printer is not at fault. also sometimes the models you download from thingiverse.com have errors or other issues and are interpreted by the slicer incorrectly causing print errors. i use cura and I've heard simplify 3d works well also.\nhere are my settings in cura\nlayer height 0.2 mm\ninitial layer height 0.25-0.3 mm\nwall thickness 0.8 mm and sometimes 1.2 mm (must be a multiple of the hot end of 0.4 mm)\ntop/bottom thickness same as above\ninfill density 25% but depends on what you want\ninfill layer thickness 0.2 mm\nprinting temperature 200 or 205 C and i use HatchBox PLA, works great for me\nbuild plate temperature 60 C\ndiameter 1.75 mm\nflow 100%\nenable retraction yes\nretraction distance 1-2mm depending on what you print (very important setting and the next one too)\nretraction speed 25 mm\nprint speed 35-50 mm per second depending on the detail/complexity of your print\nand i don't recommend anything over 55 maybe 60 max, any higher and it affect the quality of the print\ninfill speed 55 mm per second\ntravel speed 65-70mm per second\ninitial layer speed 15 mm per second 1st layer is the most important and should be slow\nalways print with a skirt just to get the nozzle flowing correctly usually the first lap doesnt stick right so this way it doesnt ruin anything if you have a skirt enabled.\nif your object is taller id print with a brim.\nthe only thing i do not like about cura is the support is auto generated and you have no control or way to adjust it, but at least all of the prints i did did not need support material\nalso add 10-20 min more to what ever cura estimates for print time\ni use fusion 360 to build models (see photo for the small robot i designed the frame) its a line follower using a attiny85 micro-controller\nworked right out of the box, just needed to level the bed. I'd lower the bed before turning the printer on so the hot end doesn't drag and scrape the bed.\nPROS\nvery accurate printer, I printed a fidget spinner which the center parts are separate and spin (see photo) and there was a 0.4mm gap between the spinner body and the center parts. once printed i didn't even need to break them lose, I've also printed a hing which had a 0.2mm gap between the hinge pin and the central part that hold the pin, after printing it needed a little effort to move and now moves freely. (see photo for the hinge) It's impressive to be able to print a hinge or fidget spinner as \"one piece\" or at the same time yet each part moves separately.\nthe bed is easy to level\neasy to load filament\nheated bed\ncolor display\nhot end has not clogged once on me\nprint quality is very nice\nthe benchy boat printed flawlessly and even created a 8 mm bridge between two pillars to form the window and it doesn't droop down\n\nCONS\nsomething vibrates while it does the travel moves, which is a bit noisy but does not seem to affect the prints\nbed takes a bit of time to heat up\nthe cooling fan makes a odd hum but is not noticeable once the the print begins, the fan shroud could use a rubber grommet to stop the vibration\nthe x axis motor gets pretty hot, but having a small fan resting on the z axis arm quickly cools this down and the same probably goes for the driver board and y axis motors but they are inside the case so i can't feel them. the newer version of this printer  has a fan built into the case to cool those components and it is possible to add a fan underneath the printer, theres a grill for it but no fan. for longer prints than 2 hr id install a fan underneath just to be safe.\nthis printer can print most of what i need but the bed size can be limiting at times","summary":"best printer for the money and great build quality","unixReviewTime":1496361600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1475"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fr2LIuPFL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61a58vaghcL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xz8YN1xoL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717Y6VPdygL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iXOnQI-xL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q4nNRshNL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KqbdVUI+L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819S5+8kxfL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91FaG5v4aSL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"6","verified":true,"reviewTime":"05 15, 2017","reviewerID":"A3MRSPM3QZKJPJ","asin":"B01FL49VZE","style":{"Color:":" White"},"reviewerName":"MontanaMonk","reviewText":"I did a lot shopping before ordering this printer.  I was ready to pay several times more than the price of this printer, but after seeing some reviews, I thought this would do most of what I expected to print.  I believe I made a good choice.  The printer is easy to use and works well.  I did a rough level of the build platform, initially, and fine tuned it after a couple test prints.  I haven't had to level again.  I scratched the masking tape that covered the build platform and replaced it with strips of 1-3/8 inch blue painter tape.  That has worked well.  If a strip becomes worn, I just replace the strip, rather than replacing the entire surface and I haven't had any problems.  I find that it is easier to remove a project from the platform if I print a raft with the model (a raft is a thin layer of material between the model and the platform).  It is easier to get a tool under the raft to release the model and the raft is easily separated from the model.  I have used PLA filament from two manufacturers for all printing.  The two types print at different temperatures (180 and 205) and both work well.  I design most of my projects using Sketchup or openSCAD but have also downloaded and modified some models from thingiverse.  Two software packages are provided with the printer but I have only used the provided Cura software.  So far, it has done everything I needed to do and it is easy to use.

I wasn't expecting much from the printer so my expectations weren't high.  I watched as many YouTube videos on setting up the printer as I could.  As soon as I got the printer I flashed the screen and rom as well as changed its settings according to the videos.  I didn't use the filament that came with the printer as there was very little of it.  I bought some Inland PLA filament here on Amazon and loaded that instead.  I started printing the included model of the cat and it came out great.  I started downloading .stl files from Thingiverse and printing them without issue (Using Cura to slice).  All was well and then my prints went to garbage.  I watched more 3d print videos and apparently my bed was out of level.  This is where the fun begins, NOT!  I thought I would have to send the machine back because it seemed no matter what technique I used to level the bed my prints were still garbage.  Finally I watched a video that suggested using a business card for each of the four corners (I had been using a piece of paper)... that did the trick.  After practice, I can level the bed in no time flat.  Again watch videos on leveling.  I also had to clear a filament jam which was interesting.. again, another video to watch.\n\nI started playing with various bed temps as well as filament temps.  I bought other types of filament to see what worked the best.  Let me give you a heads up, if you are going to use ABS... Don't.  It's a headache.. doable but still a headache with all the things you need to do to get it to stick properly.  I did some ABS prints and they came out great but again.. a headache.  I also found that about middle of the road for temperature depending on what the filament calls for is what worked for me.  For PLA 60c (Edit: 40c is fine after the first layer) was perfect and for ABS I sliced whatever I was printing with the bed set to 60.  Once the print would start I would up the bed temp to 80c.  The bed would only get to around 78c.  For ABS to work I had also used an Elmer's glue stick on my blue 3m masking tape covered bed to get it to stick.  Again, stick with PLA.  Oh I failed to mention, when the initial masking tape comes off the bed plate which it will, you can cover it back up with 3M blue masking tape, the same kind you use when you paint.\n\nSince I have played, I can pretty much tell by what I am printing what setting I should use.  I can only suggest that you play around and watch a lot of videos.  At this price and for a single spool of filament you should be having fun and learning.  I have since moved on from using Cura and am now using Simplify3d which is rather pricey but I really like it.\n\nThe small build plate is a challenge as a lot of models that you may want to print will be much bigger.  Scaling has its issues.  Trying to take off supports when the part of the model it is connected to can be tricky.\n\nI included a picture of my latest print (Not sure why it shows up on Amazon sideways).  This had to be scaled down significantly from the original and lost some detail in regards to the terminator's hydraulics around the mouth and back of the head.  But if you want to print bigger, you are going to spend a lot more on a printer.  I am pushing this thing to its limits and I am coming out with some great prints.  I have also bought another 3d printer with a larger print bed but I will not give this one up for my smaller projects.","summary":"Amazing, inexpensive 3d printer which takes a little patience to get used to.","unixReviewTime":1490659200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1477"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qWy-gV6CL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qWy-gV6CL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"3","verified":true,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2017","reviewerID":"AGSKIJJSWCVSW","asin":"B01FL49VZE","style":{"Color:":" White"},"reviewerName":"TimeTraveller","reviewText":"--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE AFTER 2 MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros:\nStill in love with the quality and accuracy of the prints\nWhen it comes to dimensional accuracy of small sized prints this printer beats my other printer, the Printrbot Simple Metal hands down!\n\nCONS\nWiFi upload support is really poor\n\nThere is no specific pattern or explanation for why some files upload and some don't, but a \"cache\" file existing on the SD Card seems to be the problem. Each time, I remove this cache file from the SD Card and then try to upload the gcode via WiFi, I have better results. But even this solution is ineffective in case of large prints especially those above 2KB.\n\nPrinter stops before printing is completed!\n\nThere is no guarantee that larger prints will complete. The printer comes to a sudden stop for no apparent reason.\nJust yesterday, this happened to one of my prints at 96% - Pausing and Unpausing the print did nothing to improve the situation\n\nSD Card support is primitive\nYou have to switch off the printer before you load new prints on to it. If you eject the SD Card when the printer is on, and add files to it and plug it back in, the printer reports a Card read / unrecognized error\n\n**************************\nMy 60-Day Opinion:\n**************************\n\nStill a great printer. I have seen articles on the Web stating that we need to update the firmware, but this is at odds with Monoprice product warranty - therefore, I'm undecided on what the next step should be.\n\nAs much as I hate to do this, I've downgraded from 5 Stars to 4. :-(\n\n============================================================================================\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nI've owned a Printrbot SimpleMetal for a few years now, and despite spending a bundle on upgrading to a heated bed, endless hours of calibration and bed levelling, the printer continues to throw one or the other tantrum each day I try to get a decent print out of it.\n\nTherefore, this review is geared for users who want to get their projects out the door real quick and not spend hours tinkering and customizing their 3D printers. This is what I wanted to focus on after a seemingly endless and tiresome experience with the Printrbot SimpleMetal.\n\nI bought the Monoprice Mini after reading the other reviews and having received multiple responses to my question on this product (Thanks to all those who responded!) here on Amazon. Less than 2 days I've had it, I say no regrets for having bought one! In addition to the sample lucky cat model, I printed some that I designed and sliced on Repetier host using slic3r and this printer simply continued to deliver one good print after another!\n\nI'm astounded by the out of the box quality of the prints! In the last 24 hours, this little machine has been running for at least 13 hours printing. My family has taken a liking to the cat and I managed to print two of them in a row one for my wife, and another for my son!\n\nHowever there are a few minor things that you need to look out for:\n\n--------------------\nUneven foot pegs\n--------------------\n\nThis setback almost made me skeptical about the printer even before I turned it on! My printer came with uneven foot pegs - this is the first thing to check for. There was a visible difference between the foot peg immediately below the LCD panel and the other three. I stuck a few layers of painter tape cut to the shape of the foot peg until the printer stopped wobbling.\n\n--------------------\nWhen slicing, position the object to the middle of the bed on the Slicer software!\n--------------------\n\nI simply copied a GCODE file that I sliced in slic3r in Repetier Host. At the time, I moved the model towards the back of the bed before I sliced it. When I printed it in the Mini, the model was spaced so far towards the end of the bed that the print head moved past the edge of the print bed and hit the limit switch making a terrible stuttering noise. The picture shows one such print. The skirt line is printed on the extreme edge of the print bed.\n\nNot good! Therefore, make sure that you slice the model by placing it to the middle of the bed in the slicer software.\n\n--------------------\nThe factory bed lining won't last very long\n--------------------\n\nI printed a GCODE file that was sliced for Printrbot. The bed temperature was set to 62, and the extruder temp was set to 205. This is because the conditions in my room cause a temperature drop during printing. Therefore I had to keep the temperatures a few degrees higher to compensate for the drop.\nPrinting this GCODE on the Mini caused my PLA part to be nearly welded to the bed, and I had to tear the bed lining to get the part of the bed.\n\nI used Kapton tape as replacement and it's definitely an easier liner to work with.

While this is the best 3D printer you could purchase for what I paid (at the time I bought it), there is some setup and trial and error that should be expected with any 3D printer.  You will need to play with the temps a little bit to get the printing down and this will change each time depending on the filament you will use.  As I have now purchased two of these (one for my Father In-Law) I have had both power supplies fail.  Mine failed after 2 months, the other failed out of the box.

The poor packing caused the unit to take a lot more abuse than it should have during shipping, so it arrived all outta whack. Part of the initial teething I suffered through was due to  a cracked extruder arm not putting enough pressure on the filament against the feeder gear so it failed to extrude several times. Once I identified the problem I grabbed the model from thingiverse, remixed it to be a bit stronger, and printed a replacement arm out of ABS on my FFC Pro which has worked fine. The extruder arm is known to be a weak link and anyone who has a MP Select Mini would do well to print a replacement arm to keep on hand if the OEM arm breaks. Same with the extruder base plate. Those 2 items are why I didn't give it a 5-star rating.\n\nNow, the thing is so dialed in now that I don't use anything to promote adhesion (a glass plate with glue or hairspray)  I just turn on the power, put in the memory card, select the model to print, go away to do other things or go to sleep, and come back to a 99.75% perfect print. (there's always some sort of clean up to do like removing supports or stuff like that.)\n\nParts just pop off with gentle persuasion from a spatula. Most times I can just grab the printed item and pull it off with only light pressure.\n\nI included pics of some of the prints and parts. The xmas ornament was printed with 4 lines of brim and no supports...using a speed multiplier of 1.7  The 50mm to 30mm fan adapter required supports but came out incredibly well...again, at speed multiplier of 1.7.\n\nI've modded the printer extensively... I've replaced the external power supply brick with an internal meanwell LRS-150 12 power supply and switch, I upgraded the cooling fan and added 2 cooling fans inside the case, I added a 10mm stabilizing arm to the Z axis gantry which acts as a fulcrum point on which I've mounted a counter-weighted Go Pro camera so I can do time lapse videos of prints without the weight of the camera affecting the print performance. I've added a filament guide and spool spacer and a proper knob on the jog dial.\n\nSince Thanksgiving I've put over 300 hours of use on it and it has worked amazingly well.\n\nI haven't had a single print fail due to the printer. I've had failures...but they turned out to be due to bad models (non manifold, flipped triangles, etc) which, once repaired with NETFAB or S3D, printed beautifully.\n\nInitial review below:\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nHeard it was a good unit. Thought it would take some of the work load off my Replicator 2, Creator X, and Rostock V2. First test print failed. Extruder failed to maintain temperature so the nozzel clogged and it air-printed the last 8% of the \"cat\" model.\n\nNoticed 8C-10C swings in temperatures while printing. Can't determine if this is soft/hardware-related of if it is due to the completely unsatisfactory packaging it arrived in (The printer was shipped in its box, which was placed into a larger box with crumpled paper for shipping. The larger box didn't work well because Amazon never taped it shut. It arrived with ZERO trace of packaging tape on the larger box and FedEx stated I could place a claim but it's not their fault.\n\nWill adjust settings in Cura to raise print temps to 200C versus the 195C the cat model is set up with.\n\nWill adjust my review accordingly if things so better.","summary":"Good printer, horrible shipping from Amazon","unixReviewTime":1473465600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1483"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uu7KOVvZL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"905","verified":true,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2016","reviewerID":"A2S4WVP7XZMWVJ","asin":"B01FL49VZE","style":{"Color:":" White"},"reviewerName":"Richard S.","reviewText":"Red robot = $2700 3D printer\nBlack robot = $200 3D printer (this one)\n\nI'm stunned that you can now buy a 3D printer for $200 and get this good of a result!","summary":"A print comparison","unixReviewTime":1471132800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1484"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MbQOfFrSL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2018","reviewerID":"A2QD6N30ZTB0AK","asin":"B01FPG89CE","reviewerName":"REM","reviewText":"Cheap and works perfectly from my experience of having it for the last 2 months.","summary":"Relatively cheap and works","unixReviewTime":1515456000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1485"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hPVmJhHPL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71t6BNARCXL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GREDGjA2L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716UMCrrfVL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"11 18, 2016","reviewerID":"A2B1VRXTWB024D","asin":"B01FPG89CE","reviewerName":"Malibu Shary","reviewText":"Ok!

Personally, I find the \"I turned it on.  The lights flashed and the house didn't burn down.\" type of reviews to be pretty worthless.  So, after working with this for a month and a half, here are my impressions...\n\n1. If you're used to using litmus paper to measure pH, this will give you a much more accurate and precise reading.  That's assuming that you have an adequate sized sample.  A couple of ml is sufficient for a test strip.  You can get by with less, but 50 ml is about as low as I'd go with this guy.\n\n2. The supplied buffer powders (pH 4.01 and 6.85 when mixed into 250 ml of distilled water) are appropriate for calibrating in the pH meter for hydroponic applications. (Normally a pH range of 5.5-6.2)  If you're using this to measure saltwater aquariums (nominal pH of 7.6-8.4, depending on the type of fish), you'll need to pick up a 9.18 pH buffer to calibrate the alkaline range.  Here's a link to a set of three:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/3-pack-pH-Meter-Buffer-Solution-Powder-Set-For-Quick-and-Easy-pH-Calibration-Packet-of-4-00-6-86-and-9-18/dp/B01E6V4CD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">3-pack pH Meter Buffer Solution Powder Set For Quick and Easy pH Calibration, Packet of 4.00, 6.86 and 9.18</a>&nbsp;Calibration does drift over time, so you'll need to recalbrate if high accuracy is needed.  Interval between necessary calibrations will vary depending on usage and environmental factors.  Personally, I was doing it once a week, but I don't have a need for particularly high accuracy. YMMV.\n\n3. Usage couldn't be easier...you rinse the electrode with distilled water, turn the meter on, immerse the end in the solution you're testing, stir it a bit and wait for the reading to stabilize. It takes 15-30 seconds.  Rinse the electrode off when finished and replace the cap to keep it from drying out.\n\n4. Readings have a 0.01 pH resolution.  Accuracy is +- 0.05 pH, so that last digit doesn't mean very much.  If you need to differentiate a pH of 7.02 from 7.05, you need a lab instrument.  On the other hand, this works perfectly for most real-world applications where extreme accuracy isn't needed...your crops aren't going to care if their roots are in a 6.02 vs. 6.03 nutrient solution.\n\nSummary...this is easy to use, accurate (enough) and inexpensive.  If you're looking for a pH meter and don't want to spend for a laboratory version, this is a good way to go.  Long story short, it works and works well.\n\n(Lastly...If you don't understand pH, here's a brief explanation.  pH refers to the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution.  Low numbers are acidic.  A pH of 7.0 is neutral (pure water).  As numbers go up, the solution is increasingly more alkaline.  The overall range is from 0-14.  Think Sulfuric Acid at one extreme and a concentrated Lye solution at the other.  Just for reference, white vinegar (an acetic acid solution) is around 2.4.  A baking soda solution is around 9.  If you get one of these, you can play around, measure all kinds of stuff and thoroughly annoy your spouse, parents and/or kids.

It comes in a case sized perfectly to hold the meter plus a clearly written, easy to follow instruction manual. At first I wasn't sure where the batteries (referred to in the instructions) were because the flat black cap on the top that conceals the battery compartment is not labeled in any way to indicate that's where the batteries go and it required prying it off to get inside. I was a little nervous about doing it the first time because I wasn't sure if the lid was supposed to come off or not. The detachable battery compartment in the cap takes two replaceable button batteries, and it comes with them pre-installed. I really like that you take the battery-holding part completely out to install the batteries because those little suckers are really easy to drop and lose; you want to be able to install them on a tabletop.\n\nFour packets of pH buffer powder are included, and while these don't fit neatly inside the case, they can be folded to fit. These are used for calibrating the tester. The process for determining the pH of a liquid is straightforward and pretty idiot-proof, and if you forget how to do it, you've got the instructions right there stowed in the case. I find this very helpful, unlike some testers I've seen with the instructions on a box that winds up being thrown away soon after the meter is taken out of it.\n\nI've always had trouble understanding pH, and I suspect many people do. Gardeners have to be aware of pH to be able to grow plants well, but it's those who make wine who really have to understand pH. The 0 to 14 range of this meter is suitable for both. I suggest googling \"pHiguring out pH\"&mdash;geared toward winemakers&mdash;for a good explanation. This particular pen is designed for measuring water pH, but I'm sure there will be those who are going to want to stick it into their ferments.\n\nI have just one suggestion for improving this product, and that is to add Semos' URL to the nice little translucent info card that is included with it. (It's lying on the top of the case in one of my photos.) That's the kind of card that's great to stick on the fridge or to keep in a wallet in case you need to troubleshoot or need more help. As it stands, it's a thank you card that you don't want to throw away because it's so nice, but then it doesn't have much of a purpose without further contact information included on it.

It turns out to be a great investment. Now our teenager daughter manages to have a small business using the printer. Anyway. my daughter is away and she asked me to print her products out and ship them.\n\nShe has been using the small kitchen knife to lift the printing products out from the printer. But with my lack of experience, I had a hard time of inserting the knife underneath them to lift up, so I bought the \"Synkia 3D Print Removal Tool 3D Printer Pen Tool\" hoping my task easier. To prevent the damage on the surface of the printer, my daughter put the painter's tapes on it and whenever I used the kitchen knife, I tore the tapes and had to replace them with a new layer of the blue tape stripes. I hoped the removal tool might not damage the tapes, so I wouldn't have to change them every time after removing the printed object. The dream didn't come true. Even with the new removal tool, I still change the damaged layers fo the blue tape, but definitely, the job got easier. The tool is very thin and long, so it is  easy to go under the printed objects. So much less tedious to do the job. But be careful not to break it while using it. Although that didn't happen to me, it is so thin and bending well I am very careful using it.\n\n [...].

Then these magnets are for them.  I read another reviewer's post, and I suppose that is how he is using these magnets, but I'll dare to say most people are not attaching their magnets horizontally on an overhead steel beam.  That being said, I did a few tests of my own.  I took a 25lb weight and tried it with one magnet.  Nope.  How about 2 magnets?  Nah.  3 magnets?  No.  4 magnets?  What do you think?  I then when down to a 10lb weight to see if it would stay on the side of a steel locker.  Well, the magnet slid almost 2 the floor, but it did keep the 10lb weight from tipping over and pulling off the strap, once the weight reached the floor.  I did guide the weight and strap with my hand, or the whole thing would have come off the locker.  See photos.  I understand physics a bit.  I get the difference between holding a vertical load and a horizontal load.  I will try it sometime with a horizontal load of 25lbs sometime when I figure out an application for using these hooks for a horizontal load--and I have a horizontal magnetic surface handy.  I suppose if someone had a shop light hooked to an engine hoist / cherry picker and the arm was pretty much horizontal, they could attach a work light in a horizontal fashion and hold it and the hooks in place with these magnets.  I'm not saying they don't work, I'm just saying the advertisement should be more clear about the way the magnets hold a load.  That being said, they are nice looking magnets, and I bought them to hold my keys and carabiners on the side of the fridge.  I also wanted to be able to move them around whenever I wanted.  I wanted these magnets to hold a little bit of weight, but not a huge amount, so they do that.  So, a little more truth in advertising would be nice.  I know it's the seller's job to sell magnets.  I will also do more careful research in the future with my important magnet purchases.  Buy them--just don't expect them to hold much more than your smaller items vertically--and certainly not 25lbs vertically.  I'll report back once I conclude my horizontal experiments, if I can ever think of something practical...\n\n*** UPDATE 9/23/16  ****  I cleaned out a locker, and I TRIED to hang just a 10lb weight from the hook attached horizontally so the magnet had the entire surface of the shelf that is horizontal in the locker from which to draw.  Not even close to holding my 10lb weight.  So, I'm calling a \"mythbusting\" official BS on these magnets.  Not that anyone else needs to care, but it makes me feel better, lol.  I was skeptical originally that a magnetic surface about the size of a penny could hold 25lbs.  I knew this was something I had to see for myself.  Anyway...these magnets will do a nice job holding my keys on the side of the fridge.  That they will hold...","summary":"I'm calling BS on this one -- nice magnets, but not quite as advertised -- not even close - 1 star","unixReviewTime":1474588800,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1494"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514BTfZLY-L._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51V29s3dWmL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51f-ornaCJL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LhWedjAkL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HF8kfjMYL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"vote":"3","verified":true,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2018","reviewerID":"A2HGD9YMCLR19F","asin":"B01G9K7KCK","style":{"Size:":" 0-0.5\"/12.7mm DIGR-0055"},"reviewerName":"Jakobe","reviewText":"A good dial indicator for my needs, I use it to level the print bed on my 3d printer (Creality CR10s).

But all can be torn. 10X tape is a thick layer of glue, a checkerboard of interlocked plastic-like strips, and a thick layer of clear plastic on top.  The red/black checkerboard material looks and feels like the stuff used to make those cheap tarps - only thicker.

You will not be disappointed!\n\nThe New Matter MOD-t is a great 1st 3d Printer. I would suggest anyone NEW to 3d printers start with something like this unit. It is super easy to use and you will be able to get a taste of what 3d printing is all about from this unit. It produces quality prints, it prints fast enough to satisfy, it is easy to maintain, and New Matter has excellent customer support for this product. For a seasoned 3d printing veteran or a very advanced user, they might be left wanting a little more, but if you do not know how to build a 3d printer from scratch and do not want to mess with constantly configuring/testing/leveling your printer....then no worries.\n\nPros:\n- Covered printing bay to prevent young ones from sticking their hands in and burning themselves or messing up a print\n- All in one unit. This thing is ready to print directly from the New Matter Store as soon as you open\n- There is no need to learn about slicing/3d modeling programs initially. Just download any items from sites like thingiverse or pinshape and print all you want.\n- The New Matter Store (which you will want to print from if you are new to 3d printers) already has pre-designed items available to print. Just login to the New Matter Site....select an item you would like to print and hit print\n- WIFI functionality. The MOD-t does not have to be tethered to the PC by USB cable. You can send prints to your printer wireless over a wireless network\n- Excellent customer service\n- It is a unique design and is aesthetically pleasing to look at...so this thing would be fine to have in a home office without looking out of place\n- Auto alignment process with no worries about leveling due to the unique design. So, never worry about having to configure this printer or constantly fight to keep your settings right.\n\nCons:\n- You might out grow the print area as it only prints around approx. 6x4x5 inches.\n- The warranty is only 90 days (but from what I can tell Customer Service is excellent and will most likely assist you even outside of the 90 day warranty)\n- It is a unique design (which was also a pro in my book) and it might be more challenging for a basic tinkerer to work on as opposed to some of the more popular 3d printers out there (such as the Prusa i3, which has a HUGE following and community to assist with anything really)\n- The included filament roll stand (which mounts to the back of the unit) is not big enough for most aftermarket filament rolls such as Hatchbox. The included stand is just barely off so you are better off purchasing or printing a stand to accommodate bigger rolls.","summary":"The MOD-t is a VERY good choice for a beginner or someone with young children","unixReviewTime":1467072000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1508"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nL9EfJxML._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"19","verified":true,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2017","reviewerID":"A1NJ77X0JSRH8T","asin":"B01HCVJ3K2","reviewerName":"Fwayne","reviewText":"Great quality and huge load handling.  I am using an MPCNC build  driven by a RAMPS 1.4.  The RAMPS board simply cannot handle large amperage loads (melts the connectors).  It is easy as pie to connect this to your RAMPS (or other bed output)  This works very simply, it is essentially a big solid state relay thats allowing your controller to use very little amperage, and offloading the true high amp load onto itself and the power supply.  This keeps things safe and allows full power to reach your bed heater.\n\nNOTES:\n1. Use the largest gauge stranded cable you can fit into the connectors for the bed and power supply connections.  Too small and the wires may overheat.\n2. Use the absolute shortest length of wire you can get away with.  High amperage DC loads are best over short wire lengths.\n3. Avoid unnecessary splices or connectors in line, thee add resistance and are possible overheating issues.\n4. use 24 volt power and bed if possible to lower the overall amperage required.\n5.  you must electrically insulate the board from touching any metal surfaces, it will short out!  of course you have a 3d printer so make a base or box!\n\nFor me this  board improved warm up times by at least 50% and much more stable.\n\nI've noted some users have had to use different connections.

But one of two of that product failed me a few months after install.  So I decided to try these out, purchasing two of them.  I replaced the bad one and installed one in my newest printer.  I generally only use these on the heat beds.  My printer's hot ends don't pull enough amperage to warrant their own.  So one is now installed on my Monoprice Maker Select Plus and the other on my JGAurora A5 printer.\n\nFirst they are quite small and aren't using as large of a heat sink as the last brand I got that was rated at 55A.  This model is easier to find a spot for it in my printers than the other model I had bought which was almost two times larger.  This model is rated at 35A max.\n\nThe boards I got were silk screened on the board as BIQU version 1.3.  They use a High Amp NPQ030N06 FET power transistor.  (Isn't that 30 amps not 35 amps?)  They will accept either 12VDC or 24VDC as their input and output.  They are rated at 35 Amps but I wonder based on the chip rating of 30 amps.  Hmmm?\n\nThe connection to the motherboard and hot bed are listed as not being polarity required.  Of course, the 12VDC or 24VDC from your power supply IS polarity sensitive and must have the plus on the inside and the minus on the outside.  That's crucial as if you do it wrong, you can blow up your printer's power supply, hot bed, motherboard and this board all at once.  Hook it up right the first time.  Don't guess.  If your hot bed and motherboard has marked polarity settings, I advise you keep those polarities hooked up the same even if it doesn't supposedly matter.\n\nYou won't get any instructions with these.  So I found a pictorial diagram of the hookup that I attached to this review so you can see how to do it.\n\nWhen you first install one of these, watch it like a hawk the first few days it's powered up.  These type of high amperage connections can smoke or catch fire if they malfunction badly.  Its doubtful that most printers power supplies will hit the maximum amperage of this chip.  To tell, take the printer's power supply wattage and divide by the voltage supplied.  That will give you a maximum amperage.  So a 350W 24VDC power supply would output up to 14.6 Amps max.  A 250W 12VDC power supply would output about 21 Amps max.  Almost all 24V printers and most 12V printers fall well under the board's rating.  But if you have significantly beefed up your heat bed and power supply, you may need to consider these maximums.  Of course when a power supply or hot bed shorts or badly malfunctions, they could cook these chips still.  Use caution as you can be at fire starting amperage here.\n\nIf you have a place you can mount this in front of it's own fan to cool it would be best.  These transistors can produce a good deal of heat, as noted by the large heat sink on the board.  They liberate this heat from the heat sink to the air around them.  So don't put one of these next to your motherboard or other sensitive electronics unless you have something dissipating that heat like a good fan.  You don't want that heat going over your motherboard.  Also you will need to elevate it using stand offs or thick insulative material off of any metal its attached to.  Be sure your chassis grounds are good.  Don't rely on double sided tape or 3D printed plastic to mount it.  When these get hot, they can melt adhesives and plastics like PLA.  Mount them with metal hardware only so they are grounded on your chassis.\n\nTime will tell if these last.  The other brand lasted less than 5 months.  Hopefully these make it longer.  If they don't make it at least a year, I'll come back here and update this review and lower its rating.","summary":"Working on 2 printers heat beds AOK.","unixReviewTime":1532822400,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1510"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P4JSzO+JL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ik5UsxJgL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"vote":"2","verified":true,"reviewTime":"11 2, 2017","reviewerID":"A24YQMBNH1APSA","asin":"B00004YOG0","style":{"Size Name:":" 1 Inch"},"reviewerName":"supp","reviewText":"Perfect sockets for my shop stool.

It's great for repairing toys especially.  I've glued my daughters 3\" \"Kristof\" figure who's head broke off.  I've repairs a 3\" \"Flynn Rider\" who had a leg/hip replacement which required a small steel pin and a touch of gorilla glue.  I've also used it on a 3\" \"Dragons\" \"Heather\" figure who's body broke in two, she too required a steel pin and a drop or two of Gorilla Glue.\n\nThis glue doesnt work particularly well in areas which are continually subjected to moisture however I have successfully repaired my daughters watering can as well... Ill post additional photos as Im able to in updates.\n\nTIP: when repairing small figures you will need a heavy/large paper clip, pair of \"dyke\" pliers which also have a wire cutting edge, a drill with a small drill bit almost the same size of the paper clip in circumference.\n\nFrom there you will need to drill each direction creating a cavity in the area which you are repairing to allow the pre-measured/cut paper clip piece you've prepared for the \"steel pin\" used to give extra strength to the figure in the repaired area.  Insert a small drop in each piece of the toy to be rejoined and then run the part under water allowing the water to hit the drop of gorilla glue (water activates the glue), insert the piece of paper clip which you've pre-cut/pre-measured into the cavity which you've placed the drop of Gorilla Glue and connect both parts to be joined.\n\nYou will need a small clamp or a piece of strong packing tape to hold the joined pieces together while drying as the glue does EXPAND.  I like to take a wet paper towel after about 5-10 min and when I see the glue expanding outward pack it down with the wet paper towel crushing all the bubbles which start during the activation of the glue as it dries so ther is a smoother area after drying.\n\nI'll at times take a matching sharpie and after the glued area is dry, I will color the glued area with the sharpie to mask the area which was repaired.  SEE MY PHOTOS OF A RECENT REPAIR DONE EARLIER TODAY.\n\nI've also used this glue on floor tiles in a commercial building as a quick repair alternative to adhesive/mortar or mastic etc.  see photos, they aren't pretty until the glue is colored with a black/brown sharpie, then they look ok.\n\nThe tile was shattered into many pieces and was loose until I cleaned the area, added some water for activation and then the glue, using a wet paper towel patting it down as it raised and dried.  It was quick and able to be walked on in less than an hour.  Threw a mat over it and It worked ok for a quick fix.\n\nThis glue isn't perfect as it doesn't hold well for all repairs.  However it's the best I've used and there are times which a stronger commercial adhesive is best for certain applications.  Good luck with whatever your repairing, take your time these things take patients.\n\nNOTE: If you appreciated this review please give it a thumbs up/like your helping me to continue to give honest/unbiased insight into products Ive used and you may have questions about.

It was nothing too severe, but I could see that sometimes a securely fastened blade would shift slightly during a cut. I was able to fix the problem with a few simple steps.\n\nI noticed the blade holder had some burrs, so I sanded these off to increase the contact area and to roughen the mating surfaces (using 180 grit sandpaper). I also sanded the contact area of each blade on both sides. Then I cleaned everything with alcohol, including the screws and threads (which appeared to have some grease on them). Since then I haven't had any more slipping of blades and am very satisfied with this set.\n\nI found the cutting blades worked very well in both hard and soft woods, easily as well as the larger regular sized blades. The kerf is quite small, perhaps less than the regular sized blades (I did not measure, so cant say for certain).\n\nI also did some measurements, by tracing around the holder and blades on a piece of graph paper - see the accompanying photo.\n1. the blades are held in place by two M4 screws, set about 3/8 apart.\n2. all attachments are either 1-5/16 or 1-11/16 long.\n3. attachments are 13/16 wide at the connection point\n4. cutting blade width is about 3/8 wide on the cutting end.\n\nI used the short wood cutting blade recently to replace a lever operator in a 20+ year old wood window. The mechanism was built-in to the window, and for awhile I thought I would have to completely remove the window and destroy some trim pieces in order to get to the lever. Then I thought of my multimaster and decided I had nothing to loose. I was able to surgically cut out two trim pieces, install the new lever, then simply re-install the trim as the saw kerf was so thin (all with the window in-place on a second story bedroom). Its not 100% perfect, but its close enough that only careful inspect would reveal the cuts.

It includes the custom slits in the filter that fit the Flair Hoover SticVac housing perfectly. I include photos of the filter, housing, and vacuum.\n\nKeep in mind you do NOT have to have replace this filter when it gets dirty. It is the type that can be hand washed, dried, and put back in. But because I have severe allergies I chose to get a new one. People with a little extra know how would also be able to make their own exhaust filter for this vacuum out of similar materials found at many DIY home stores or hardware stores.\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nAdditional Information For Curious Consumers:\n\nI purchased this for my Hoover Flair Bagless Stick Vacuum, Model # S2220 although the ad states it also fits Hoover Flair Stick Vac Models: S2201 and S2200.\nThis vacuum takes three filters; one primary inner filter, and two secondary outer filters (this exhaust filter):\n\nPrimary (inner) Filter # 59136-055 or 59136055\nSecondary (outer) Filter # 59136-022 or 59136022 (the filter I am reviewing)\n\nI also recommend the Hoover Flair Stick vacuum. Average price is about $60 right now. Its nearly as powerful as my regular Hoover WindTunnel. Its much lighter, maneuvers much easier, gets into tighter spaces (and under the couch), is easier to store, and works on both rugs and hard floors just as well. Its not as good as a Shark, but its the perfect vacuum for my everyday jobs, especially when Im too tired to haul out the big vacuum.\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nThis ad says it's Hoover brand with UPC # 700953603166, but most genuine Hoover parts UPC numbers usually start with 073502 - the first numbers are the ones that identify the company in any UPC number. My package did not come with UPC numbers, it only came with a UPC bar code and I of course do not have a scanner to check to see what the number actually is. All of this may not matter to the average customer, but I include it as an FYI for those who want to know. Either way, the filter seems to match the one that came with my vacuum exactly.\n\nBut I'm not thrilled that the ad was not clear about having only one filter per package, but I should have known better and read more carefully. My vacuum uses an exhaust filter on each side. I'll be washing the other filter, since there are two in my vacuum, one on each side.\n\nI think this item is a little over priced here (at just under $5 for one exhaust filter) but I choose to buy it at this price so I didn't have to waste money on gas to buy one locally (the shop where they sell them is about two gallons of gas away from my home) so my unhappiness with the price is not reflected in my star rating of the product quality. I only mention it because I feel it's important for consumers to be able to make informed decisions.\n\nKnowing which part to get is sometimes hard, if you don't have your manual because the model number of the vacuum isn't always easy to find. Sometimes you have to look on the bottom of the vacuum. That's what I had to do, to be sure of my vacuum's model number so I knew which filters to buy.

But I needed to install the 5/16 insert into hardwood without any mistakes, so I went with the bolt, two nuts, and a drill press method.  This method was perfect.  The drill press kept the insert straight and all I had to do was wrench them in, the threads did the rest.  I think using the add-on tool along with a drill press for alignment would've also worked.\n\nOther thoughts.

It's great for repairing toys especially.  I've glued my daughters 3\" \"Kristof\" figure who's head broke off.  I've repairs a 3\" \"Flynn Rider\" who had a leg/hip replacement which required a small steel pin and a touch of gorilla glue.  I've also used it on a 3\" \"Dragons\" \"Heather\" figure who's body broke in two, she too required a steel pin and a drop or two of Gorilla Glue.\n\nThis glue doesnt work particularly well in areas which are continually subjected to moisture however I have successfully repaired my daughters watering can as well... Ill post additional photos as Im able to in updates.\n\nTIP: when repairing small figures you will need a heavy/large paper clip, pair of \"dyke\" pliers which also have a wire cutting edge, a drill with a small drill bit almost the same size of the paper clip in circumference.\n\nFrom there you will need to drill each direction creating a cavity in the area which you are repairing to allow the pre-measured/cut paper clip piece you've prepared for the \"steel pin\" used to give extra strength to the figure in the repaired area.  Insert a small drop in each piece of the toy to be rejoined and then run the part under water allowing the water to hit the drop of gorilla glue (water activates the glue), insert the piece of paper clip which you've pre-cut/pre-measured into the cavity which you've placed the drop of Gorilla Glue and connect both parts to be joined.\n\nYou will need a small clamp or a piece of strong packing tape to hold the joined pieces together while drying as the glue does EXPAND.  I like to take a wet paper towel after about 5-10 min and when I see the glue expanding outward pack it down with the wet paper towel crushing all the bubbles which start during the activation of the glue as it dries so ther is a smoother area after drying.\n\nI'll at times take a matching sharpie and after the glued area is dry, I will color the glued area with the sharpie to mask the area which was repaired.  SEE MY PHOTOS OF A RECENT REPAIR DONE EARLIER TODAY.\n\nI've also used this glue on floor tiles in a commercial building as a quick repair alternative to adhesive/mortar or mastic etc.  see photos, they aren't pretty until the glue is colored with a black/brown sharpie, then they look ok.\n\nThe tile was shattered into many pieces and was loose until I cleaned the area, added some water for activation and then the glue, using a wet paper towel patting it down as it raised and dried.  It was quick and able to be walked on in less than an hour.  Threw a mat over it and It worked ok for a quick fix.\n\nThis glue isn't perfect as it doesn't hold well for all repairs.  However it's the best I've used and there are times which a stronger commercial adhesive is best for certain applications.  Good luck with whatever your repairing, take your time these things take patients.\n\nNOTE: If you appreciated this review please give it a thumbs up/like your helping me to continue to give honest/unbiased insight into products Ive used and you may have questions about.

The idea that this is the size of a credit card is neat, but given the percentage of the viewer material in comparison to the whole, makes this nearly useless.\n\nThis is my first magnetic viewer so I wouldn't know exactly what to expect but after fussing with this part that arrived, it seems I wasted more time trying to figure out what I've done wrong as apposed to being productive with a better product.  As another reviewer mentioned, the card is too thick.  It has 2 layers of laminate (one of which would not affect the magnetic field), I assume a printed instruction sheet is just printer paper plus the magnetic material itself.  The first image attached shows a small N45 neodymium magnet and its field.  All the bright colored particles are NOT the magnetic material.  Under a microscope, they seem to be balls of gel.  I don't know how to make this type of material but I believe these balls of gel interfere with the \"image\" you see,  These balls don't move or change color.  What you see is what you get.  There is also a \"speck\" of lint or something in the middle of the image.  As another review mentioned, this speck is under the laminate, so it's a permanent fixture in this viewer.  The scratches may or may not have been there upon arrival, but I just got this card today and I don't think I used it that much.  The second photo shows how the product was not even laminated \"squarely\".  Everything is misaligned and even though it's not a BIG deal, it is bothersome that someone would pay any kind of money for a product that this company didn't care about the assembly or QC of a product before leaving their doors.  Regarding the third photo, I would commend this company by stamping the Made In U.S.A emblem, which makes me happy, but this label nearly kept the laminate from encapsulating the whole thing.

So I purchased this driver because I need to drive a NEMA 23 motor for my application and I also need to allow the motor to spin free at some stages. The problem I encountered is that I cannot make this driver to release the motor from it's \"hold\" state. In the paper that came with it, it says \"ENA+, ENA-: Motor free\" but that function does not work no matter what state you set the ENA+ and ENA- inputs. As a matter of fact, it operates the same way even when nothing is connected to the ENA ports. I contacted SainSmart support and did get an answer within 12 hours but they were basically referring me to their \"wiki\" (that is how they called it) which is nothing other than a PDF of the same paper that comes in the box. I do not know if the one I got is defective or the documentation is wrong but at this point I have to return it because I do not have any more time to troubleshoot and did not get meaningful help from SainSmart.\n\n UPDATE 6/1/2018 - I received a second email from SainSmart stating that it should be releasing the hold of the motor when ENA+ and ENA- are set to High (+5V) the motor should be released and spin freely. They also suggested to check my connections which I did but my unit does not function this way so I received a defective one. I raised the rating to 4 stars since this is not a design issue but I still had to return my unit so based on my experience I cannot give it 5 stars. \n\nFor applications that do not need to allow the motor to spin freely, it works very well. I connected it to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bipolar-2-8A-269oz-in-1-9Nm-Stepper-Motor-Nema-23/dp/B00PNEPI0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bipolar 2.8A 269oz.in/1.9Nm Stepper Motor Nema 23</a>&nbsp;with a 24V power supply and while on hold the draw was at 0.30A. When I drive it at about 60RPM with no load (on the shaft) it draws 1.2A.\n\nTo drive the motor with an Arduino (any flavor) you can use the following code. This code should allow the motor to spin freely when no button is pressed. You will need a power supply at 24V, an Arduino and 2 momentary switches with the following connections. Note that in my case, I used an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/L7805CV-Voltage-Regulator/dp/B009B0JCCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">L7805CV Voltage Regulator</a>&nbsp;to provide 5V to the Arduino via the Vin pin (See attached pictures).\nFrom the Arduino\nPin 8 to DIR-\nPin 9 to PUL-\nPin 10 to ENA- (This did not work for me but I include it because it should have)\n\nFrom +5V\n+5V to PUL+\n+5V to DIR+\n+5V to ENA+\n\nMomentary Switch Connections\nConnect the 2 switches to pin 2 and pin 3 of the Arduino and the other side of the switches to the GND. When pin 2 is low it will spin the motor forward and pin 3 low will spin it in reverse.\n\nYou can change the microseconds delay variable \"FastStepMicros\" and \"SlowStepMicros\" time to adjust the speed. You can also change the \"Steps\" variable to adjust the revolutions every time you press a switch. The code will spin 1 revolution every time you press a switch because when SW1,2,3 and 4 are at the \"On\" position on the driver (see documentation) 400 steps is 360 degrees (for an 1.8 degree motor)\n\nconst int ForwardPinIn=2; //Connect to momentary switch to GND\nconst int ReversePinIn=3; //Connect to momentary switch to GND\nconst int DirPinOut=8;\nconst int PulPinOut=9;\nconst int EnPinOut=10;\nconst int LEDPin=13;\nunsigned long FastStepMicros=200;\nunsigned long SlowStepMicros=400;\nint Steps=400;\nconst bool EnableMotor=LOW;\nconst bool DisableMotor=HIGH;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  pinMode(ForwardPinIn, INPUT_PULLUP);\n  pinMode(ReversePinIn, INPUT_PULLUP);\n  pinMode(DirPinOut, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(PulPinOut, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(EnPinOut, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(LEDPin, OUTPUT);\n  digitalWrite(DirPinOut, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(PulPinOut, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(EnPinOut, HIGH);\n  digitalWrite(LEDPin, LOW);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  if(digitalRead(ForwardPinIn)==LOW){\n  SpinForward(FastStepMicros);\n  }\n  if(digitalRead(ReversePinIn)==LOW){\n  ReverseSpin(SlowStepMicros);\n  }\n}\n\nvoid ForwardSpin(unsigned long StepDelayMicros){\n  SetDirection(true); //Set to forward\n  EnMotor(true);\n  for(int x=0;x<Steps;x++){\n  digitalWrite(PulPinOut, HIGH);\n  delayMicroseconds(StepDelayMicros);\n  digitalWrite(PulPinOut, LOW);\n  delayMicroseconds(StepDelayMicros);\n  }\n  EnMotor(false);\n}\n\nvoid ReverseSpin(unsigned long StepDelayMicros){\n  SetDirection(false); //Set to reverse\n  EnMotor(true);\n  for(int x=0;x<Steps;x++){\n  digitalWrite(PulPinOut, HIGH);\n  delayMicroseconds(StepDelayMicros);\n  digitalWrite(PulPinOut, LOW);\n  delayMicroseconds(StepDelayMicros);\n  }\n  EnMotor(false);\n}\n\nvoid SetDirection(bool Forward){\n  if(Forward){\n  digitalWrite(DirPinOut, HIGH);\n  }else{\n  digitalWrite(DirPinOut, LOW);\n  }\n}\n\nvoid EnMotor(bool EnableMotor){\n  if(EnableMotor){\n  digitalWrite(EnPinOut, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(LEDPin, HIGH);\n  }else{\n  digitalWrite(EnPinOut, HIGH);\n  digitalWrite(LEDPin, LOW);\n  }\n}","summary":"Here is an Arduino example.

This seems to do the trick for me! It came packaged very well.  I let it run for a few hours out of the box to give it a quick 'burn in' before using it.  I've only had this a week, but so far so good!\n  I received the machine, did a quick probe calibration (the mini screwdrivers are included with each probe - thank you) and used the built-in function generator to go over the features.  The controls seemed logical and intuitive (however I began to use scopes in the 70's).  Triggering is always an issue, but I had no problems with this device.  The 50% trigger auto-set is nice, and the controls feel fine to me. The screen is great - 7\" - and the resolution is adequate to read everything.  It has a built in help function to explain each control (at a surface level).\n  Other reviewers complained about the probes, but I thought they were fine for my applications.  Each probe comes with various colored rings to match both ends so you can figure out in the tangle of wires that traditionally occurs which end goes to which channel at a glance - nice touch.\n  The scope 'boots up' fairly quickly in a few seconds.  I was impressed with the math functions including FFT in its many variants along with other math functions.  You can also store a waveform as a reference and then use that to compare with the 2 channels of input - nice.  Since it is a digital storage oscilloscope, there are features and drawbacks due to the design of that instrument which I won't discuss here, but this design seems to be well 'executed'.  As most of my work is well below 100mhz, the limitations of this (or ANY) instrument approaching that frequency should not be apparent.  Always buy an instrument well beyond your area of interest so it is working well in it's sweet spot for your measurements.\n\nCONS:  The manual is in 'pigeon English' and even at that it is very brief, not giving anything beyond the basic information.  This could be much improved, and could include application examples for people not familiar with using these devices.  Also the power button is on the top, which makes it difficult if it is in a shelf (as in my setup) to get to the power.  It asks the language each power up, but that takes a second to set with 1 button.\n\nSUMMARY:  Very affordable 100mhz scope with some nice features - great for general hobbyist use!","summary":"Decent oscilliscope at very affordable price","unixReviewTime":1468713600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1574"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Qj+YMGRFL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51I+ABfetHL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pTOQ10sKL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WUtwagjzL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"06 29, 2018","reviewerID":"A3C25PH9AWIHKO","asin":"B00H1V4EB2","reviewerName":"Chris Harrell","reviewText":"The cart is very strong and sturdy.\n\nOne complaint:  Made well except for one area of the cart; that is the 'squared punch outs' in the bottom of the cart which are supposed to accept the 'squared' portion on the underside of the Carriage bolts.

It really is nice being able to move a trailer, semi loaded or unloaded without putting in a lot of back breaking effort.

It kind of breaks and crumbles instead of just flexing and bending.\n\nNow, the reason I'm writing this review is that, today, I started a long print job on a large item.  The total job was going take about 5.5 hours.  I started the job in the morning before heading to work as I use OctoPrint to remotely manage my printer.  About an hour into the job, I noticed that after the first layer, and about half way into the second layer, it looked like filament was no longer being extruded.  I had assumed that the print head had a jam (which is weird for me as it would be the first ever), so I canceled the job and went back to work (hey, I gotta do SOME work at work).  When I went home for lunch to examine the printer, I noticed that the filament had been yanked out of the print head.  I inspected the filament path and immediately noticed that I couldn't draw any more filament from the spool when pulled on.  Upon closer examination of the spool, it became evident that the spool had a cross-over.  Somehow my roll of filament, several yards into the spool, had been crossed under another loop.  It could only have been done by a human, IMHO, so I'm guessing that some helpful eSun guy had the spool unroll on him so he locked the filament in place under another loop, and then rolled and taped the end of the remaining filament over it.  Now I have to wait until I get home tonight to set the printer up again.  So, I guess I don't feel confident that there's not another filament lock somewhere further into the spool?

One thing I will note here is there is no power switch. You basically plug it in to use it. What I did was plug it into a small power strip with an on/off switch, and it is surge protected now.\nSome issues I ran into were the limit switches. One was bad and  two needed to be re-soldered. Once the frame is together, these are some of the first electrical components to go into place, and with the tiny wires having to be moved around during the rest of the assembly, the wires most likely\nbroke at the solder points. Taping in place may have helped. Next thing I did was break on of the uprights for the spool holder when tightening it down. My fault as it was not pushed in all the way and I tried to draw it in with the bolt. A little ca glue solved this and I really may not use it anyway.\nOnce assembled I re-homed everything and found the broken limit switch. Luckily there was a spare in the kit which was a great thing. My first print started out OK, then I noticed the print was not in the center of the bed. I aborted that job and tried another. Better but nothing to show for it. Now after screwing around for close to 12 hours with the printer, (Drivers, 3D files, connecting to my laptop etc.) I gave up.  I'll skip right to the biggest hurdle... When I hooked this up to my laptop with the usb cable it would not recognize the printer. It showed up in the devices menu, but would not communicate. I installed the drivers from the included dvd with no luck. Searching for a resolution yielded no success, so for now I use the sd card slot which is very limiting. Just can't understand what is going here and never had this type of issue before??\nOverall I am happy with this Printer and I have a better understanding of the machine buying this kit rather than a plug and play. Sure it might have been easier, but where's the fun in that? I also made some small mods as I moved along. 1 thing I fixed was the bearing on the \"Y\" axis belt in the front. the bearing was just flopping around so I made 2 thin nylon washers to go on either side of the bearing and it works great. 2nd was putting brass washers between the bed and the springs and an extra nut to hold the bold in place while turning the wing nuts to level the bed. Works great! Now my 3rd small mod was to use a small piece of kydex on the limit switch for the \"Z\" Axis. I didn't want the nuts digging into the frame in the back so this small plate will allow me to adjust this easier if needed. Last thing I will say is, tidy up the wiring as you go. It saved me a lot of untangling later on and it just looks nicer! I also traced the frame pieces onto heavy paper to make a second frame from for a scratch built printer as a project down the road.. Overall It was a good experience for me as I enjoy building stuff. I only used the photos on the dvd to do this assembly and if you've ever built stuff from a box, this is really no different. I might upgrade the board in the near future to see if it will connect to my laptop. Not sure if it's the board or me missing something, but for now it works with just the sd card so...\nDay 3 finally yielded me some good results although I screwed up the print at around the 20% mark. I had a minor shift in the \"Y\" axis due to the belt being too loose.","summary":"Nice Project!!","unixReviewTime":1493683200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1605"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71huZC0WzlL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2018","reviewerID":"APB1PJK9IONWF","asin":"B00NA00GJW","style":{"Color:":" Orange"},"reviewerName":"Randy W.","reviewText":"Prints great in my Dremel 3D20!

Everything came in the box as expected, so I was up and running in under 10 minutes with my first print.\n\nThis printer was not originally priced at $250, and I was always tempted but wouldn't go for such a small build space for the money. Now they don't make them any more, they've lowered the price and for $250 this is an excellent buy. Most of the prints I do day to day are not going to exceed the tiny build envelope, so printing practical parts in a 100mm(4\")x100mm(4\")x130mm(5\") area is very doable.\n\nAs for the printer itself, it's not hitting in the same league as my flashforge or prusa. It's on par with my tronxy, flsun i3 and tarantula I would say. A little bit more tuning and tinkering and I bet I would have this producing some decent little prints. But for now, I want it for practical components, not model quality parts. It can print all manner of filaments, as long as they don't require a heated bed, the hotend is all metal.\n\nPros;\n  - Solid\n  - Consistent print quality\n  - Easy to get started\n\nCons\n - No attached screen, has to be tethered\n - Noisy\n\nI would not recommend a Printrbot as a first printer, it's just a little too difficult, and after reading some of these reviews it does seem their quality control can be a little lax sometimes.

The Prusa i3 MKS2 is a much simpler prospect to build (but twice the cost).\n\nThe design of this printer is excellent, it's solid and well thought out. I've spent $25 on buying the upgraded z screw, see if I can't make this a little better, but out of the box I'm extremely happy. This is well worth the $250 I paid for it and you can still get the upgrades from Printrbot to make it a little better.\n\nUpdate:\nI've added a picture.

Once I dialed in my 1st layer settings I have had nothing but success with this filament.\nFirst layer needs about 75% slower speed and 105% extrusion.  I used glue stick on the print bed for increased adhesion. My bed temperature is 90-120c depending upon the part size I am printing.  Nozzle temperature is 230-245c.  Once first layer is laid down successfully, I then encase my printer with a garbage bag to increase the ambient temps.  I then wake up to successfully printed parts, with little, if any print defects or blemishes. I am using a prusa i3 mk2s that I built from a kit.\nThis filament has great end use properties and is very tough and resistant to higher temperatures, unlike PLA. I left a part in my vehicle (Texas summer) to test this and it did not warp or deform to my surprise.  It is food safe and hydrophobic, which is nice because most filaments absorb moisture if not stored correctly. Only downside is increased \"stringing\", but through research I learned this is a common side effect of PETG.\nI have no other PETG filament experience, but given that I am extremely new to 3d printing and was able to achieve success beyond my expectations, I give this product 5 stars.

The instructions show that one screw driver is required as a tool for set-up. however, you only need the screw driver to tighten the nozzle to the extension wand, or to disassemble/ add batteries to the nozzle/wand flashlight portion (will talk about that later). it took me all of 30 seconds to snap together the hose and two nozzles to the bucket, and snap in the four casters.  The filter was already assembled and attached to the lid when i got it.  The construction of the vac is sturdy, well-made, and fully metal in the \"belly\" where it counts, with the non-metal portions being the filter on the underside of the lid, the hose and the area where the hose snaps into the side of the metal bucket, the tray the entire bucket sets on, that you snap the casters into, and that yellow handle and casing on top. the capacity is 5 gal, but you could realistically have maybe 3 gal. ash pickup tops, without getting too close to the filter.\n\nThe nice thing is, the entire bottom portion of the inside is metal, so any slightly hot ashes should be held safely, provided they are not hot enough to spark the filter at the top of the inner lid. The warning on pg. 2 of the instruction manual also clearly says, \"This vacuum is intended to pick up COLD ash...\" (caps in the instruction manual). I really like that the instruction manual is very detailed, and well-written in English (and Spanish and French). The company is Emerson Electric, and their workshop appears to be in St. Louis. I don't know where the item is made, however.\n\nAs a vacuum itself, it's not exceptionally powerful (sounds like a regular hair dryer), and my normal vacuum has much more suction. However, it easily picked up light ash from the fireplace. i could smell some amt. of the ash in the air after vacuuming, but i guess that is to be expected with something as fine as ash. this isn't a Dyson, but as far as i know, Dyson does not make metal canisters to hold dust, so this does have use.  One interesting feature, is a flashlight at the section where the handle meets the extension nozzle- i've attached a pic of the single bulb. This was useful for the fireplace, where it's dark, so you can better see what you're doing. it came with the battery installed, and worked when i tried the switch. overall, i would recommend this item, esp. for outdoor metal fire pit cleanup, or the inner section of your big grill, where it's hard to reach.  for the inside fireplace, though, i think i'll stick to my handbroom and dustpan, cuz it's easy enough by hand, and i found it a hassle to dump the ashes (lift off lid, pick up canister, dump)- ash fluffs all over.  gotta dump outside, not in the garage.","summary":"Not a Wet Vac, but picks up Ash well.","unixReviewTime":1453161600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1662"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HL8949JqL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"08 25, 2018","reviewerID":"A10042M3XO3NET","asin":"B019CY4FB4","style":{"Style:":" AC/DC Current/Low Z, Temp, Cap, Freq"},"reviewerName":"Stephen Morris","reviewText":"If you're considering whether or not to buy this multimeter, then I credit you with knowing the product or having done some research...

One thing that I wouldve liked was better cooling on the main board for the  stepper drivers, I am planning on making something for that and using a 40 mm fan to add some cooling. When I first started the calibration process it was nothing but problems. Every time I hit the store nothing would happen. I just about given up hope and was looking at ordering a whole new board but a 32 bit one when I tried one more time and when I pressed and held the knob to store after second or two there Was a beep! That made all the difference in the world everything started storing after I held the button and waited for the beep.  So if you're having problems with yours and its not storing the Settings try pressing and holding the button and waiting for the beep to see if it improves.  One problem that I am having is the extruder temperature is fluctuating significantly and causing some minor issues so it looks like Ill have to go to into in the P ID for it to make it better.

Surfaces are buttery smooth and have an excellent shine to them, right off the print bed.  Don't be alarmed when you first start priming your extruder and the filament hangs under it like a banana, as it won't coil up like other filament does. It will expand to slightly more than the diameter it started out as. You will be able to do thin wall prints, so don't worry.\n\nTake your time to get the first layer right, ensuring you really smash it down good. I've seen that other reviewers have had problems with bed adhesion, but I've had zero problems printing on a PEI coated steel sheet (Prusa MK3 and MK2.5 upgrade). Just make sure the bed is clean and squish that first layer down. See the picture of the key print - perfection bed adhesion assured a successful print.\n\nI highly recommend calibrating your extrusion multiplier for this filament (well, for all your filaments for that matter), as you really want to avoid over extruding this filament - you'll have a mess. I've had the best luck using Slic3rPE with this filament. I prefer Simplify3D, but anything sliced for this filament has zits all over it and I haven't taken the time to track it down yet. If you are having problems with zits calibrate your extrusion multiplier and try different slicing software.\n\nTurn your speed down, you won't break any speed records printing with this filament - besides, you'll get a better shine. Set your max speed for 50mm/sec and drop other speeds down for 1st layer, perimeters, etc, accordingly. Set it up for a short, fast retraction with a .6 mm z-hop - mine is set for .8 distance at 35mm/sec speed. I've got my temp set for 210C. Once dialed in, you'll easily get prints like you see in my pictures - just stick with it until you do.\n\nSo to sum it up, print it low, print it slow and you'll enjoy great prints. Prints with this filament do not seem as strong as other types of PLA, so I wouldn't recommend using it for parts that receive a lot of abuse, but it's for printing pretty stuff anyway ;)\nI highly recommend this filament, take the time to dial it in and you'll soon agree.\n\nChief","summary":"Beautiful shine without post processing, highly recommended","unixReviewTime":1536451200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1671"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TBYStHBwL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":4,"verified":false,"reviewTime":"11 20, 2017","reviewerID":"A128ZZFS41K1HC","asin":"B01BHHYIYS","style":{"Part Number:":" 4401-0811","Style:":" Fine Adjustment"},"reviewerName":"Amy Dru","reviewText":"A budget magnetic base that can hold a dial gauge reasonably well for the price.\n\nPros:\n1.

With the buttons, you set the constant output voltage and the maximum current.  There may also be a way of using it for a constant current supply, haven't tried.  It works perfectly and a great deal.  The meters show the output voltage and current or the input voltage and current.  There are four buttons that are used for the settings and three leds to show whether the output is on or off and whether the meters are showing the input voltage and current or the output voltage and current.  The only downside of this board is that you might need a \"cheat sheet\" to remind you of the button sequences and what the leds mean (see pic of my cheat sheet, I hope is correct.  If you cannot read or is incorrect, let me know.  You might have a better one).  Using buttons was clearly a way to save money.  DROK has other models that are easier to set and enclosed but much more expensive, so you have a choice (I have both).  The other thing is that since everyone is on one board, it is a little difficult to put in a case.  I removed the two input and output terminal blocks and added separate binding posts and I jumpered other separate buttons which I mounted on the box front panel.  I then cut a rectangular hole in box so the display is visible and mounted the board on some standoffs. I then pasted the cheat sheet on the top of the box.  For a power supply to feed the board, I used a left over laptop power supply (or you can buy one $10).  I also added a couple of inexpensive digital readouts so I could see the input and output at the same time (why not for $4 for both?)  I put two of these in one box using just one laptop supply for an inexpensive dual bench power supply for a fraction of the price.  Plus it was fun (for me!)  All this was no problem for me since I have been doing this stuff for fifty years (yup) but others might be better off paying more to get the unit with a knob and is enclosed.

The Arduino wakes us every 15 minutes and takes a measurement, transmits it, then goes back to sleep.  2) it is measuring the distance TO WATER!  I even turned the swim jets in my pool on to test turbulence and it works fine.\n\nGreen Pond Bridge Boat Clearance\n\nAt very low tide the clearance under Green Pond Bridge in Cape Cod is 66 or less and that is too low for the boat I use.  The tide charts for Falmouth, MA are theoretical and can vary as much as 18 from what is actually happening at the bridge.  This system monitors the clearance and transmits the information on the internet.\nAll of these parts were purchased from Amazon.\n\nTransmitter\n\nAn (Arduino) Elegoo UNO R3 board is connected to an Elegoo HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.  The UNO and the sensor calculate the distance from a fixed dock to the sea level, then transmit that data using a MakerFocus NRF24L01 Wireless Transceiver to the Receiver described below.  The Transmitter sits on the end of a dock where there is no power, so the UNO, Transceiver and Distance Sensor are powered by the energyShield 2.  This battery has special capabilities  it wakes everything up every 15 minutes.  The system takes a couple readings of the distance to the water then transmits that data, then the battery shuts it all off.  The data transmitted includes information from the battery  time, date, and voltage.\n\nI have been testing this unit at home (in Dallas) and it has been operating outside, for about 20 days.  Based on battery drain it looks like it will operate for about 4-5 months before it needs a recharge.  When the temperature drops below zero the system still works fine but the voltage reported in the battery seems low.\n\nAll of this is housed in a plastic box printed for the purpose with a FlashForge 3d Printer Creator Pro, using eSun White ABS+ filament\nPicture below.\n\nReceiver\n\nAn (Arduino) Elegoo MEGA 2560 R3 is connected to another NRF24 Transceiver to receive the data.  The MEGA does the math to convert the distance from the dock to the water, to the bridge clearance.  Then the information is displayed on an Elegoo UNO R3 Touch Screen (that also works fine on the Mega).\nPicture below.  A small plastic frame for the Receiver was also printed on the 3d printer\n\nWeb Server\n\nFinally, the information in the MEGA is transmitted over a serial bus to a Hiletgo ESP8266 NodeMCU ESP-12E Internet WIFI Development Board (Also operates using Arduino IDE programming).  This board is connected to the MEGA via the XCSOURCE Logic Level Converter and powered by a UCEC MB102 Breadboard Power Supply Module.  All mounted on an Elegoo Breadboard.  The ESP8266 is programmed to be a web server.  It connects to the internet through the modem/router provided by AT&T.\n\nPicture of my cell phone below.","summary":"Measures distance to water accurately.

But when I got my latest 3D printer from China, the quality of the parts turned out using the sample filament that came with the printer got me thinking if I should give these products a chance. Ironically, the US made PLA filament which I had purchased a few months ago was over-sized and caused the extruder to constantly slip leading to a clicking noise so annoying that I had to kill the print!\n\nTherefore,  I decided to take a chance and order this filament from eSun. And to my surprise, did it deliver! The pictures speak for themselves!\n\nTo be fair, this review applies only to this shade of Green eSun filament!\n\n------------------------\nPrint Settings:\n------------------------\n\nI printed the part in the pictures with a temperature of 210-deg-C and the bed heated to 65-deg-C. A bit on the higher side, but for the combination of the printer location and air circulation, this is what works for me.\n\nWith the print speed set to 50 mm/s, shell thickness to 1.2 mm, 20% infill and Raft enabled, this print took about 6.5 hours to complete. Better a slow and steady good print than a hurriedly delivered crappy print!  In addition, I dabbed the print bed with a popular non-toxic washable glue stick when the extruder reached 209-deg-C (see note below).\n\n------------------------\nObservations:\n------------------------\n\nFirst, I have never had a print where the Raft looks as good as the print does.\nSecond, the Raft peeled clean off the print without that tacky sound you usually hear when removing the raft.\nThird, finish on the underside of the print looked a lot better than my prints from my stock of other filaments, and the top-side of the print had an excellent finish.\nFourth and final, the color of finished part fluctuates between different shades of Green - the bright Green looks best under sunlight or bright White light.\n\nI have another roll of eSun Orange and I'm yet to test it out. I would be really shocked if it does not turn out as good.\n\nFOOTNOTE ON GLUE APPLICATION :\n\nIn most 3D printers, the bed heats up first, followed by the extruder tip because it's faster to heat the tip once the bed gets to the set temperature. Therefore, it's recommended to wait until the extruder reaches closer to the set temperature before dabbing on the glue because you don't want the glue to go dry. In my case, I wait until 209-deg-C because the print kicks off at 210-deg-C as soon as the extruder reaches the temperature.\n\nAlso, I buy myself some time to apply the glue by *Not* homing the printer before kicking off the print. I do so by usually moving the Z axis 30 - 50 mm above the bed before I hit the print button. This gives me time to dab on the glue as the printer slowly auto-homes. Obviously, these methods work best on open-bed printers where there's less obstruction to on the bed.\n\nAnd plenty of caution is recommended when working around moving printer parts and high temperatures!","summary":"Excellent PLA filament!

It is built well, comes with a nice lanyard  to hang around your neck if you are measuring frequently for your job, and the protective box w handle and snap lid is very convenient for keeping all your solutions together w the tester.","summary":"Easy to Use, Was Calibrated Well Out of the Box","unixReviewTime":1512345600,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1697"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/317w05kBVtL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"12 30, 2017","reviewerID":"A33DOL3OHTABSY","asin":"B01F194DHU","reviewerName":"Josh","reviewText":"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Taulman-BRIDGE-Filament-1-75-mm-BLACK/dp/B01F194DHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Taulman BRIDGE Filament, 1.75 mm, BLACK</a>\n\nHoly smokes this stuff is STRONG and easy to print!","summary":"Best Nylon I've used!","unixReviewTime":1514592000,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1698"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YiGaJ2MWL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nXbM6j-mL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cSaWNG0VL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BJpAjauEL._SY88.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cqUM1agVL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"06 6, 2018","reviewerID":"ATR3ZQJJEBRIM","asin":"B01F6B6R1S","reviewerName":"StevenWR","reviewText":"2nd spool ive bought im new to 3D printing my first spool was straight from monoprice and it was ok a bit on the brittle side but i thought that is just how pla is but after using this im seeing more flexibility in the brim and the part. This is printing just fine for me at 205c and bed temp at 60c and slow printing at Fine max quality with very little to no warp with the 26650 cell holders im printing which is why i bought the 3d printer. I just recently printed a battery holder as well that i made in blender. Im not using glass just the heat bed with the factory build tack and i have to have the tip extremely close or the filament will not stick to the build tack from what ive seen on youtube its a must for it to be very close but in my case a sheet of paper is to thick it must be closer to the point of the filament being partially transparent on the first line that is set down for making the parts. If your bed is warped and extruder is to far away you will have problems I know i sure do and i just replaced my heat bed not to long ago i bought the printer refurbished but they left the heat bed and it was awful completely warped all 4 corners and the center at least monoprice sent me one for free but i had to void the 90 day warranty to do so. To me that was a better option than doing the whole exchange process with the printer working fine just the bed being horrible.","summary":"Will buy this again","unixReviewTime":1528243200,"category":"industrial_and_scientific","index":"industrial_and_scientific_1699"},{"image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715iynRf8RL._SY88.jpg"],"overall":5,"verified":true,"reviewTime":"04 8, 2017","reviewerID":"A1I6QWAKT2W2RQ","asin":"B01F6B6R1S","reviewerName":"Fred T.
